## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Stabilize documentation drift**  -  1 documentation paths are out of sync.
   - Top offenders: ai_development_docs\AI_CHANGELOG.md
   - 1 paired documentation sets affected alongside drift.
   - Run `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py doc-sync --fix` after adjustments.
2. **Close documentation registry gaps**  -  1 functions are missing or stale in the registry.
   - Regenerate registry entries via `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py docs`.
3. **Harden critical error handling**  -  106 functions still lack structured error recovery.
   - Focus modules: discord/account_flow_handler.py (35.3%, missing 11/17), discord/webhook_server.py (42.9%, missing 4/7), __init__.py (50.0%, missing 1/2)
   - Convert remaining basic handlers to `@handle_errors` and add guard tests.
4. **Raise coverage for low-performing modules**  -  3 key modules remain below the 80% target.
   - Target modules: communication (64.7%, 3061 lines missing), tasks (65.4%, 203 lines missing), core (72.9%, 2458 lines missing)
   - Add scenario tests before the next full audit to lift module coverage above 80%.
5. **Retire remaining legacy references**  -  5 files still depend on legacy compatibility markers.
   - 1 legacy markers still surface during scans.
   - Review C:\Users\Julie\projects\MHM\MHM\development_docs\LEGACY_REFERENCE_REPORT.md for exact locations.
   - Use `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py legacy --apply` to replace deprecated helpers.

## Quick Wins
- Normalize 2 file(s) with non-ASCII characters via doc-sync.

## Watch List
- Documentation coverage sits at 93.50% (target 90%).
- Overall test coverage is 70.2% (18498 / 26338 statements).
- Keep an eye on untested files: communication/communication_channels/discord/webhook_handler.py (15.6%), communication/command_handlers/account_handler.py (21.3%).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py legacy --apply`  -  update legacy references in-place.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
