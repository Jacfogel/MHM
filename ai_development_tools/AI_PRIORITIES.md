## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Stabilize documentation drift**  -  1 documentation paths are out of sync.
   - Top offenders: ai_development_docs\AI_CHANGELOG.md
   - 1 paired documentation sets affected alongside drift.
   - Run `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py doc-sync --fix` after adjustments.
2. **Harden critical error handling**  -  99 functions still lack structured error recovery.
   - Focus modules: __init__.py (50.0%, missing 1/2), schemas.py (52.9%, missing 8/17), error_handling.py (56.8%, missing 16/37)
   - Convert remaining basic handlers to `@handle_errors` and add guard tests.
3. **Raise coverage for low-performing modules**  -  3 key modules remain below the 80% target.
   - Target modules: ui (64.5%, 2063 lines missing), communication (66.6%, 2479 lines missing), ai (71.9%, 480 lines missing)
   - Add scenario tests before the next full audit to lift module coverage above 80%.
4. **Retire remaining legacy references**  -  5 files still depend on legacy compatibility markers.
   - 1 legacy markers still surface during scans.
   - Review C:\Users\Julie\projects\MHM\MHM\development_docs\LEGACY_REFERENCE_REPORT.md for exact locations.
   - Use `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py legacy --apply` to replace deprecated helpers.

## Quick Wins
- Normalize 4 file(s) with non-ASCII characters via doc-sync.

## Watch List
- Documentation coverage sits at 93.91% (target 90%).
- Overall test coverage is 69.5% (16874 / 24274 statements).
- Keep an eye on untested files: communication/core/__init__.py (30.0%), ui/ui_app_qt.py (32.4%).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py legacy --apply`  -  update legacy references in-place.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
