## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Stabilize documentation drift**  -  4 documentation paths are out of sync.
   - Top offenders: tests\AI_FUNCTIONALITY_TEST_PLAN.md, development_docs\LEGACY_REFERENCE_REPORT.md, DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md, ... +1
   - 1 paired documentation sets affected alongside drift.
   - Run `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py doc-sync --fix` after adjustments.
2. **Harden critical error handling**  -  125 functions still lack structured error recovery.
   - Focus modules: __init__.py (0.0%, missing 2/2), core/__init__.py (0.0%, missing 1/1), schemas.py (52.9%, missing 8/17)
   - Convert remaining basic handlers to `@handle_errors` and add guard tests.
3. **Raise coverage for low-performing modules**  -  3 key modules remain below the 80% target.
   - Target modules: ui (52.9%, 2739 lines missing), communication (60.1%, 2667 lines missing), ai (66.1%, 579 lines missing)
   - Add scenario tests before the next full audit to lift module coverage above 80%.
4. **Retire remaining legacy references**  -  9 files still depend on legacy compatibility markers.
   - 5 legacy markers still surface during scans.
   - Review C:\Users\Julie\projects\MHM\MHM\development_docs\LEGACY_REFERENCE_REPORT.md for exact locations.
   - Use `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py legacy --apply` to replace deprecated helpers.

## Quick Wins
- Normalize 4 file(s) with non-ASCII characters via doc-sync.

## Watch List
- Documentation coverage sits at 93.71% (target 90%).
- Overall test coverage is 62.6% (14683 / 23437 statements).
- Keep an eye on untested files: communication/command_handlers/checkin_handler.py (0.0%), communication/__init__.py (11.3%).
- Plan refactors for complex hotspots: _cleanup_old_backups (backup_manager.py), restore_backup (backup_manager.py).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py legacy --apply`  -  update legacy references in-place.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
