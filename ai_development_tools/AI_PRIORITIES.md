## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Raise coverage for low-performing modules**  -  3 key modules remain below the 80% target.
   - Target modules: communication (47.5%, 3449 lines missing), ui (50.2%, 2878 lines missing), user (62.5%, 115 lines missing)
   - Add scenario tests before the next full audit to lift module coverage above 80%.

## Quick Wins
- No immediate quick wins identified. Re-run doc-sync after tackling focus items.

## Watch List
- Documentation coverage sits at Unknown% (target 90%).
- Overall test coverage is 58.1% (13476 / 23207 statements).
- Keep an eye on untested files: ai/lm_studio_manager.py (0.0%), communication/__init__.py (0.0%).
