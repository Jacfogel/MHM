## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Stabilize documentation drift**  -  6 documentation paths are out of sync.
   - Top offenders: Heading Numbering Issues, DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md, .cursor\commands\ai-functionality-tests.md, ... +3
   - Run `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py doc-sync --fix` after adjustments.
2. **Close documentation registry gaps**  -  1 functions are missing or stale in the registry.
   - Regenerate registry entries via `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py docs`.
3. **Phase 1: Replace basic try-except with decorators**  -  88 functions have try-except blocks that should use `@handle_errors` decorator.
   - Start with 26 high-priority candidates (entry points and critical operations).
   - Then process 38 medium-priority functions.
   - Apply `@handle_errors` decorator to replace basic try-except blocks.
4. **Phase 2: Categorize generic exceptions**  -  1 generic exception raises need categorization into MHMError subclasses.
   - Most common: 1 ValueError
   - Replace generic exceptions (ValueError, Exception, KeyError, TypeError) with specific MHMError subclasses.
   - See `ai_development_docs/AI_ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md` for categorization rules.
5. **Raise coverage for low-performing modules**  -  3 key modules remain below the 80% target.
   - Target modules: communication (67.3%, 2869 lines missing), ui (71.5%, 1755 lines missing), core (72.6%, 2545 lines missing)
   - Add scenario tests before the next full audit to lift module coverage above 80%.
6. **Retire remaining legacy references**  -  5 files still depend on legacy compatibility markers.
   - 1 legacy markers still surface during scans.
   - Review C:\Users\Julie\projects\MHM\MHM\development_docs\LEGACY_REFERENCE_REPORT.md for exact locations.
   - Use `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py legacy --apply` to replace deprecated helpers.

## Quick Wins
- Normalize 9 file(s) with non-ASCII characters via doc-sync.

## Watch List
- Documentation coverage sits at 93.51% (target 90%).
- Overall test coverage is 71.2% (19075 / 26798 statements).
- Keep an eye on untested files: communication/communication_channels/discord/checkin_view.py (17.1%), communication/communication_channels/discord/bot.py (45.3%).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py legacy --apply`  -  update legacy references in-place.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
