## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Stabilize documentation drift**  -  2 documentation paths are out of sync.
   - Top offenders: development_docs\LEGACY_REFERENCE_REPORT.md, ai_development_docs\AI_TESTING_GUIDE.md
   - 1 paired documentation sets affected alongside drift.
   - Run `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py doc-sync --fix` after adjustments.
2. **Close documentation registry gaps**  -  6 functions are missing or stale in the registry.
   - Document: run_mhm.py, run_tests.py
   - Regenerate registry entries via `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py docs`.
3. **Harden critical error handling**  -  120 functions still lack structured error recovery.
   - Focus modules: schemas.py (52.9%, missing 8/17), error_handling.py (56.8%, missing 16/37), file_auditor.py (64.3%, missing 5/14)
   - Convert remaining basic handlers to `@handle_errors` and add guard tests.
4. **Raise coverage for low-performing modules**  -  3 key modules remain below the 80% target.
   - Target modules: communication (46.5%, 3371 lines missing), ui (50.0%, 2883 lines missing), user (62.5%, 115 lines missing)
   - Add scenario tests before the next full audit to lift module coverage above 80%.
5. **Retire remaining legacy references**  -  9 files still depend on legacy compatibility markers.
   - 5 legacy markers still surface during scans.
   - Review C:\Users\Julie\projects\MHM\MHM\development_docs\LEGACY_REFERENCE_REPORT.md for exact locations.
   - Use `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py legacy --apply` to replace deprecated helpers.

## Quick Wins
- Normalize 6 file(s) with non-ASCII characters via doc-sync.

## Watch List
- Documentation coverage sits at 93.23% (target 90%).
- Overall test coverage is 57.9% (13107 / 22651 statements).
- Keep an eye on untested files: ai/lm_studio_manager.py (0.0%), communication/__init__.py (0.0%).
- Plan refactors for complex hotspots: _cleanup_old_backups (backup_manager.py), restore_backup (backup_manager.py).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py legacy --apply`  -  update legacy references in-place.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
