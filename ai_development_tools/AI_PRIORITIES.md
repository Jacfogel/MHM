## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Stabilize documentation drift**  -  5 documentation paths are out of sync.
   - Top offenders: Heading Numbering Issues, DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md, .cursor\commands\ai-functionality-tests.md, ... +3
   - Run `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py doc-sync --fix` after adjustments.
2. **Harden critical error handling**  -  91 functions still lack structured error recovery.
   - Focus modules: __init__.py (50.0%, missing 1/2), error_handling.py (56.8%, missing 16/37), file_auditor.py (64.3%, missing 5/14)
   - Convert remaining basic handlers to `@handle_errors` and add guard tests.
3. **Raise coverage for low-performing modules**  -  3 key modules remain below the 80% target.
   - Target modules: communication (67.1%, 2893 lines missing), ui (71.5%, 1754 lines missing), core (72.2%, 2590 lines missing)
   - Add scenario tests before the next full audit to lift module coverage above 80%.
4. **Retire remaining legacy references**  -  5 files still depend on legacy compatibility markers.
   - 1 legacy markers still surface during scans.
   - Review C:\Users\Julie\projects\MHM\MHM\development_docs\LEGACY_REFERENCE_REPORT.md for exact locations.
   - Use `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py legacy --apply` to replace deprecated helpers.

## Quick Wins
- Normalize 9 file(s) with non-ASCII characters via doc-sync.

## Watch List
- Documentation coverage sits at 93.57% (target 90%).
- Overall test coverage is 71.0% (19046 / 26841 statements).
- Keep an eye on untested files: communication/communication_channels/discord/checkin_view.py (17.1%), communication/communication_channels/discord/bot.py (45.3%).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py legacy --apply`  -  update legacy references in-place.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
