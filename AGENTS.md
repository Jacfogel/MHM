# AI Agent Guidelines (For Cursor, Codex, etc.)

- This project is a personal mental health assistant written for and by a beginner programmer with AI assistance.
- Keep documentation concise and organized:
  - `README.md` for the overview, features, and plans
  - `HOW_TO_RUN.md` for setup instructions
  - `IMPROVEMENTS.md` for the change log
- Update `requirements.txt` when adding dependencies.
- Document feature changes in `IMPROVEMENTS.md` and update `README.md` when applicable.
- After modifications, run `python run_mhm.py` to verify the UI still launches (it may fail in headless environments).
