# Codex Agent Guidelines

- If you add new Python dependencies, update `requirements.txt`.
- Document feature changes or bug fixes in `README.md` or other relevant docs.
- Record notable development milestones in `IMPROVEMENTS.md` using the existing format.
- Keep instructions focused on the current primary workflow (Discord daily check-ins and local AI chat).
