## Overview
Use this file to get fast orientation before assisting the user. Entries are ordered newest first and trimmed to keep context compact.

## How to Update This File
1. Add a new entry at the top summarising the change in 2-4 bullets.
2. Keep the title short: "YYYY-MM-DD - Brief Title **COMPLETED**".
3. Reference affected areas only when essential for decision-making.
4. Move older entries to ai_development_tools\archive\AI_CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md to stay within 10-15 total.

Template:
```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD - Brief Title **COMPLETED**
- Key accomplishment in one sentence
- Extra critical detail if needed
- User impact or follow-up note
```

Guidelines:
- Keep entries concise
- Focus on what was accomplished and why it matters
- Limit entries to 1 per chat session. Exceptions may be made for multiple unrelated changes
- Maintain chronological order (most recent first)
- REMOVE OLDER ENTRIES when adding new ones to keep context short
- Target 10-15 recent entries maximum for optimal AI context window usage

### 2025-09-29 - AI Development Tools Comprehensive Review and Optimization **COMPLETED**
- Normalised metrics extraction by sharing `standard_exclusions.py` across discovery, decision support, and audits.
- Corrected coverage calculations and refactored docs tooling for consistent percentages.
- Completed full regression tests after the tooling overhaul.

### 2025-09-28 - Windows Task Scheduler Issue Resolution **COMPLETED**
- Patched scheduler tests to mock `set_wake_timer`, preventing thousands of real Windows tasks.

- Verified zero task leakage with the complete test suite.

### 2025-09-28 - Test Performance and File Location Fixes **COMPLETED**
- Repaired user-data performance tests and aligned expectations after mocking side effects.
- Relocated cache and coverage artefacts to dedicated directories for cleaner structure.

### 2025-09-28 - Generated Documentation Standards Implementation **COMPLETED**
- Added generated-file headers (tool name, timestamp, sources) across eight documentation outputs.
- Consolidated command docs into action-oriented instructions with PowerShell-safe patterns.
- Regenerated each artefact to comply with the new template.

### 2025-09-28 - Test File Cleanup and Schedule Editor Fix **COMPLETED**
- Updated the schedule editor to respect patched data directories during tests.
- Ensured temporary request files are cleaned automatically after test runs.
- Brought the affected scheduler tests back to green.

### 2025-09-28 - Scheduler Test Failure Fix **COMPLETED**
- Adjusted scheduler error-handling expectations so resilience tests no longer fail intermittently.
- Hardened behaviour tests against noisy log output and race conditions.

### 2025-09-27 - Legacy Code Management and Cleanup **COMPLETED**
- Removed obsolete modules and aligned error messaging with the unified helper naming convention.
- Scrubbed lingering references to legacy functions across docs and comments.
- Kept regression risk low by exercising the behaviour suite.

### 2025-09-27 - Discord Test Warning Fixes and Resource Cleanup **COMPLETED**
- Eliminated noisy Discord test warnings and cleaned up residual test artefacts.
