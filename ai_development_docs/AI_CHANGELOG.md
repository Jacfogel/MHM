## Overview
Use this file to get fast orientation before assisting the user. Entries are ordered newest first and trimmed to keep context compact.

## How to Update This File
1. Add a new entry at the top summarising the change in 2-4 bullets.
2. Keep the title short: "YYYY-MM-DD - Brief Title **COMPLETED**".
3. Reference affected areas only when essential for decision-making.
4. Move older entries to ai_development_tools\archive\AI_CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md to stay within 10-15 total.

Template:
```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD - Brief Title **COMPLETED**
- Key accomplishment in one sentence
- Extra critical detail if needed

```

Guidelines:
- Keep entries concise
- Focus on what was accomplished and why it matters
- Limit entries to 1 per chat session. Exceptions may be made for multiple unrelated changes
- Maintain chronological order (most recent first)
- REMOVE OLDER ENTRIES when adding new ones to keep context short
