## Overview
Use this file to get fast orientation before assisting the user. Entries are ordered newest first and trimmed to keep context compact.

## How to Update This File
1. Add a new entry at the top summarising the change in 2-4 bullets.
2. Keep the title short: "YYYY-MM-DD - Brief Title **COMPLETED**".
3. Reference affected areas only when essential for decision-making.
4. Move older entries to ai_development_tools\archive\AI_CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md to stay within 10-15 total.

Template:
```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD - Brief Title **COMPLETED**
