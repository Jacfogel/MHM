## How to Add Changes

When adding new changes to this brief changelog, follow this format:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD - Brief Title ✅. **COMPLETED**
- Key accomplishment or fix in one sentence
- Additional important details if needed
- Impact or benefit of the change
```

Guidelines:
- Keep entries concise and action‑oriented
- Focus on what was accomplished and why it matters

- Fixed Windows file locking during log rotation that was causing app.log and errors.log to stop updating
- Improved `BackupDirectoryRotatingFileHandler` with better Windows file handling and recovery mechanisms

- Fixed critical issue where Discord bot was not processing `!` and `/` commands due to incorrect command handling
- Removed `return` statement in Discord bot's `on_message` event that was preventing commands from reaching the interaction manager
- Commands were being processed by Discord's built-in system and then discarded instead of going through our custom command handling
- Added enhanced logging to track command detection and processing flow
- **Impact**: Both `!help` and `/help` commands now work correctly, providing users with proper command discovery and functionality

### 2025-09-13 - Checkin Flow State Persistence and Overwrite Fix ✅. **COMPLETED**
- Fixed critical issue where checkin flows were lost on system restart due to in-memory state storage
- Added persistent storage for conversation flow states in `data/conversation_states.json`
- Fixed checkin flow overwrite issue - new checkins were silently overwriting existing active checkins
- Added protection against starting new checkins when one is already active
- Added `/restart` command to explicitly restart checkin flows when needed
- Reduced overly aggressive checkin cancellation - only cancels for truly interfering message types
- **Impact**: Users can now complete checkins even if system restarts during the flow, and won't lose progress to accidental overwrites

### 2025-09-13 - AI Response Quality and Command Parsing Fixes ✅. **COMPLETED**
- Fixed duplicate AI processing and inappropriate command classification for emotional distress messages
- Enhanced command parsing logic to skip AI calls for clearly non-command messages (confidence = 0.0)
- Disabled AI enhancement for help commands to prevent duplicate processing
- Updated AI prompts with conversational engagement guidelines to always leave natural openings
- Eliminated inappropriate data responses to emotional pleas; now provides empathetic support
- **Remaining**: Message truncation and need for stronger conversational endings

### 2025-09-13 - Logging Style Enforcement + Docs ?. **COMPLETED**
- Fixed remaining multi-arg logger calls (converted to f-strings) and added static check to enforce no more than one positional arg to any `*.logger.*` call
- Extended static logger check to forbid `logging.getLogger(__name__)` in app code (allowed in `core/logger.py`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, `ai_tools/`)
- Updated `core/schemas.py` to use `get_component_logger('main')` for consistency
- Profile/help sanity: profile display verified as formatted text; general help points users to in-app 'commands' instead of docs

### 2025-09-13 - Scale Normalization + Discord Docs ?. **COMPLETED**
- Normalized all mood/energy displays to 1–5 across command handlers (status, history, mood trends)
- Added targeted behavior tests asserting “/5” rendering for status, history, and trends
- Introduced `communication/communication_channels/discord/DISCORD.md` with consolidated Discord command reference (developer/admin doc); in-app commands do not reference docs directly
- Cleaned `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` to point to `communication/communication_channels/discord/DISCORD.md` instead of duplicating commands

### 2025-09-12 - Commands Help + Report Length Safeguard ✅ COMPLETED
- Added concise in-bot command list (help + new `commands` intent) sourced from central registry
- Excluded report-style intents (analytics/profile/schedule/messages/status) from AI enhancement to avoid truncation
- Full suite green: 1405 passed, 1 skipped

### 2025-09-12 - Analytics Scale Normalization (Mood/Energy) ✅ PARTIAL
