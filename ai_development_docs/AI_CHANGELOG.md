### 2025-10-24 - AI Quick Reference Cleanup **COMPLETED**
- Normalized `AI_SESSION_STARTER.md`, `AI_REFERENCE.md`, and `AI_LOGGING_GUIDE.md` to plain ASCII and tightened section headings/paired-doc links.
- Trimmed advice duplicated by the Cursor rules, keeping the quick references focused on troubleshooting, communication cues, logging workflows, and maintenance.
- Highlighted follow-up considerations (e.g., potential PowerShell cheat sheet) without adding new tasks.

### 2025-10-24 - Cursor Rules & Commands Refresh **COMPLETED**
- Streamlined all Cursor command templates (/start, /audit, /full-audit, /docs, /test, /refactor, /explore-options, /triage-issue, /review, /close, /git) to concise checklists that reference authoritative docs.
- Removed unused commands (/status, /improve-system) and the legacy commands README; added scoped rules for core/communication/UI/tests plus i-tools.mdc for audit guidance.
- Restructured .cursor/rules/ with updated critical/context guidance and new quality-standards.mdc; ensured ASCII-safe content and corrected glob patterns.


### 2025-10-23 - UI Service Management Integration **COMPLETED**
- **Service Detection Fix**: Updated UI's `is_service_running()` method to use centralized `get_service_processes()` function, enabling detection of both UI-managed and headless services.
- **Service Startup Fix**: Fixed `prepare_launch_environment()` in `run_mhm.py` to include `PYTHONPATH = script_dir`, resolving `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'core'` when UI starts services.
- **Unified Service Management**: UI can now properly detect, start, stop, and restart services without conflicts between headless and UI-managed service processes.
- **Environment Setup**: Both headless service manager and UI now use consistent Python path configuration for reliable service startup.

### 2025-10-21 - Documentation & Testing Improvements **COMPLETED**
- **ASCII Compliance**: Fixed all non-ASCII characters in documentation files (CHANGELOG_DETAIL.md, AI_CHANGELOG.md) by replacing smart quotes, arrows, and special characters with ASCII equivalents.
- **Path Drift Resolution**: Improved documentation sync checker with 87.5% reduction in false positives (8â†’1 path drift issues) through enhanced pattern matching and context-aware extraction.
- **Test Suite Stabilization**: Fixed 9 logging violations in `regenerate_coverage_metrics.py` by converting old-style string formatting to f-strings, ensuring all 1866 tests pass.
- **Error Handling Progress**: Added @handle_errors decorators to service_utilities.py Throttler class, improving error handling coverage from 91.6% to 91.7%.
- **Documentation Sync Enhancement**: Implemented code block detection, advanced filtering for method calls/Python operators, and context-aware path extraction to reduce false positives.

### 2025-10-21 - Coverage Workflow Stabilisation & AI Report Refresh **COMPLETED**
- **Coverage Regeneration**: Reworked `regenerate_coverage_metrics.py` to capture pytest logs, skip redundant combines, consolidate shard databases, and publish HTML to `ai_development_tools/coverage_html/` while migrating legacy assets.
- **Audit Experience**: Restored `_run_essential_tools_only` and `_run_contributing_tools` so fast and full audits rehydrate status/priorities correctly and push maintenance steps (doc-sync, validation, quick status).
- **AI Documents**: Recast `_generate_ai_priorities_document` to surface ranked focus items + quick wins/watch list; AI status now keeps the factual snapshot without duplicating action items.
- **Scheduler Fix**: Hardened reminder selection weighting logic to make coverage tests deterministic.
- **Logs & Docs**: Coverage logs moved to `ai_development_tools/logs/coverage_regeneration/`; README and planning docs updated to match.

### 2025-10-20 - Audit Reporting Refresh & Coverage Follow-up **IN PROGRESS**
- **AI-Facing Reports**: Rebuilt `_generate_ai_status_document`, `_generate_ai_priorities_document`, and `_generate_consolidated_report` to surface real metrics (documentation drift, error handling, coverage gaps, complexity hotspots) instead of placeholders.
- **New TODO/Plan Items**: Logged follow-up tasks for fixing the failing coverage regeneration run and consolidating legacy coverage artefacts.
- **Coverage Investigation**: Full audit confirms coverage step still fails and leaves shard `.coverage` files plus multiple HTML directories; captured next actions in planning docs.
- **Files Modified**: ai_development_tools/services/operations.py, TODO.md, development_docs/PLANS.md, ai_development_tools/AI_STATUS.md, ai_development_tools/AI_PRIORITIES.md, ai_development_tools/consolidated_report.txt, ai_development_tools/ai_audit_detailed_results.json

### 2025-10-16 - Audit Optimization + UI Fix + Plan Cleanup

**What Changed**: Optimized audit performance, fixed UI error, and cleaned up completed plans

**Results**:
- **Audit Performance**: Fast mode now skips unused imports checker (completes in ~30 seconds)
- **UI Fix**: Fixed 'Ui_Dialog_user_analytics' object has no attribute 'tabWidget' error
- **Plan Cleanup**: Removed 3 fully completed plans from PLANS.md while preserving incomplete work
- **System Health**: All tests passing (1848 passed, 1 skipped, 4 warnings)

### 2025-10-16 - Test Suite Fixes + UI Features

**What Changed**: Fixed test suite hanging and multiple test failures, plus implemented UI features

**Results**:
- Fixed analytics tests (get_checkins_by_days vs get_recent_checkins mismatch)
- Fixed legacy fields compatibility and quantitative summary tests  
- Resolved UI test hanging with mock-based approach (no Qt initialization)
- Implemented User Analytics dialog and Message Editor with full CRUD
- All 1848 tests pass (1 skipped, 4 warnings)

**Key Testing Insights**:
- Qt components in tests require proper mocking to avoid hanging
- Analytics tests must match backend function usage (get_checkins_by_days vs get_recent_checkins)
- Mock-based testing can provide same coverage without complex dependencies
- Test patching must target the correct import paths and function names

**Files**: 4 test files + 1 analytics file + 6 UI files (2 designs, 2 dialogs, 2 generated)

### 2025-10-16 - CRITICAL: Windows Task Buildup Issue Resolved

**What Changed**: Fixed tests creating real Windows scheduled tasks (598 tasks cleaned up)

**Results**: 0 Windows tasks remaining, all 1,849 tests passing without system pollution

**Fix**: Added proper mocking to 3 scheduler tests, updated testing documentation with prevention requirements

---

### 2025-10-15 - Unused Imports Cleanup - Test Files Phase 1 Complete

**What Changed**: Cleaned 37+ test files across 7 batches, fixed test isolation issues

**Results**:
- 37+ test files cleaned: behavior (25), UI (8), unit (4) files
- ~200+ imports removed: json (30+), tempfile (15+), MagicMock (20+), os (25+), sys (10+)
- All 1848 tests passing, service working correctly
- Fixed 4 validation tests (Pydantic data structure)
- Fixed logger test isolation (global _verbose_mode state)

**Key Discoveries**:
- Test mocking requires imports at module level (MagicMock, patch objects)
- Import cleanup revealed hidden test isolation issues
- Linter limitations: static analysis misses dynamic usage in mocks
- Editor state issues: unsaved changes can cause import errors

**Remaining**: 3 batches pending (unit, integration, AI tests)

---

### 2025-10-15 - Unused Imports Cleanup - UI Files Complete

**What Changed**: Cleaned 16 UI files and 3 production files (165 unused imports removed)

**Results**:
- 165 imports removed: Qt widgets (50+), dead `get_logger` (16), type hints (30+), schedule mgmt (20+)
- 110 -> 95 files (-24% reduction), 677 -> 512 imports
- Service working, 1847/1848 tests passing

**Key Finding**: Test mocking requires imports at module level - kept `determine_file_path`, `get_available_channels`, `os`

**Remaining**: Test files (~90 files, ~500 imports) deferred

---

### 2025-10-13 - Unused Imports Cleanup - AI Development Tools Complete

**What Changed**: Cleaned all 18 files in ai_development_tools/ directory (59 unused imports removed)

**Results**:
- 18 files cleaned: All analysis, audit, generation, and documentation tools
- 59 imports removed: os (10), json (6), type hints (12), misc (31)
- Zero ai_development_tools files remain in unused imports report
- All tools tested and working correctly

**Impact**:
- **Before**: 136 files with issues, 750 total unused imports
- **After**: 120 files with issues (-16), 691 total unused imports (-59)
- All development tools now exemplify clean code standards

**Remaining**: UI files (~30) and test files (~80) deferred for future cleanup

---

### 2025-10-13 - Unused Imports Cleanup - Production Code Complete

**What Changed**: Cleaned all unused imports from production code (47 files across ai/, core/, communication/, tasks/, user/)

**Results**:
- 47 files cleaned, ~170 imports removed
- 2 bugs fixed (missing imports)
- 1848 tests pass, service starts successfully
- 100% of production code scope complete

**Key Patterns Identified**:
- Dead code: `error_handler` -> use `@handle_errors` decorator
- Logger pattern: `get_logger` -> use `get_component_logger()`
- Error handling: `@handle_errors` eliminates exception imports
- Test mocking: Some imports needed at module level for tests

**Files Updated by Directory**:
- ai/ (4), user/ (3), tasks/ (1)
- communication/: command_handlers (3), channels (8), core (4), message_processing (4)
- core/: All 21 production files

**Bugs Fixed**:
1. command_registry.py: Missing `handle_errors` import (used 16x)
2. base_handler.py: Removed `List` still used in type hints (fixed)

**Scope**: Production code only. UI, tests, and ai_development_tools excluded.

---

### 2025-10-13 - Added Unused Imports Detection Tool

**What Changed**: Created automated tool to detect and categorize unused imports across codebase

**Key Points**:
- New tool: `ai_development_tools/unused_imports_checker.py` using pylint
- Integrated into audit pipeline (both fast and full modes)
- Command: `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py unused-imports`
- Categorizes: obvious unused, type hints, re-exports, conditional imports, star imports
- Generated report: `development_docs/UNUSED_IMPORTS_REPORT.md`

**Initial Scan**: 954 unused imports in 175 files (951 obvious, 3 conditional)

**Integration Points**:
- AI_STATUS.md includes "Unused Imports Status" section
- AI_PRIORITIES.md includes "Unused Imports Priorities" section
- consolidated_report.txt includes "UNUSED IMPORTS STATUS" section
- Cursor commands updated: audit.md, docs.md, status.md

**Files**: unused_imports_checker.py (new), services/operations.py, cursor commands, documentation guides

**UX Enhancement**: Progress updates every 10 files - shows count, percentage, and live issue count to prevent confusion about tool freezing

---

### 2025-10-13 - Consolidated Legacy Daily Checkin Files **COMPLETED**
- **Problem Fixed**: User had two separate checkin files (daily_checkins.json + checkins.json) from legacy format
- **Solution**: Merged 33 entries from daily_checkins.json into checkins.json, sorted chronologically, deleted legacy file
- **Result**: Single unified checkins.json with 54 entries (June 10 - October 11, 2025)
- **Files**: data/users/me581649-4533-4f13-9aeb-da8cb64b8342/ - daily_checkins.json deleted, checkins.json updated

### 2025-10-13 - User Index Refactoring: Removed Redundant Data Cache **COMPLETED**
- **Problem Fixed**: user_index.json stored user data in THREE places: flat lookups, "users" cache, and account.json files
- **Solution**: Removed "users" cache object, kept only flat lookup mappings (username/email/discord/phone -> UUID)
- **Comprehensive Sweep**: Found 5 additional issues after user reported empty dropdown
  1. Admin UI refresh_user_list() reading from removed cache (CRITICAL)
  2. Backup validation iterating ALL keys as user IDs (CRITICAL - broken logic)
  3. Test utilities creating OLD index structure (3 files)
- **All Fixes Applied**: UI reads account.json; backup extracts UUIDs from values; all tests use flat structure
- **Architecture**: account.json is now single source of truth; index only stores O(1) lookup mappings
- **Code Reduction**: ~70 lines removed from user_data_manager.py and user_management.py
- **Performance**: Still O(1) lookups via flat mappings; directory scan fallback remains
- **Testing**: All 1848 tests passed; UI dropdown populated; backup validation works correctly
- **Impact**: Eliminated double redundancy, simplified maintenance, removed sync complexity
- **Files**: 10 files modified (core, ui, tests) + 2 doc files

### 2025-10-13 - Automated Weekly Backup System **COMPLETED**
- **Problem Fixed**: User data was not being backed up automatically - `data/backups` was empty
- **Solution**: Added check-based backup system to daily scheduler (runs at 01:00, before log archival at 02:00)
- **Backup Logic**: Creates backup if no backups exist OR last backup is 7+ days old
- **Retention**: Keeps last 10 backups with 30-day retention (max 10 files in `data/backups/`)
- **Contents**: User data + config files (excludes logs)
- **Testing**: Verified backup creation (48 files), manifest metadata, check logic prevents duplicates
- **Impact**: Automatic weekly data protection with minimal storage footprint
- **Files**: core/scheduler.py, QUICK_REFERENCE.md, ai_development_docs/AI_REFERENCE.md

### 2025-10-12 - Fixed Test Logging: Headers, Isolation, and Rotation **COMPLETED**
- **Three Issues Fixed**: Test logs missing headers, tests polluting production directories, redundant rotation checks
- **Root Causes**:
  1. Log rotation overwrote formatted headers with simple messages
  2. `ConversationFlowManager` used hardcoded `"data/conversation_states.json"` bypassing test isolation
  3. `session_log_rotation_check` had redundant/inappropriate rotation checks
- **Fixes**:
  1. Created `_write_test_log_header()` helper; rotation now writes proper formatted headers
  2. Updated `conversation_flow_manager.py` to use `os.path.join(BASE_DATA_DIR, "conversation_states.json")`
  3. Removed redundant rotation checks; rotation ONLY at session start when files exceed 5MB
- **Verification**: 1848 tests passed; production dirs NOT polluted; test dirs properly used; logs have proper headers
- **Impact**: Test logs readable, tests isolated, rotation predictable
- **Files**: tests/conftest.py, communication/message_processing/conversation_flow_manager.py

### 2025-10-11 - Fixed Two Critical Errors: AttributeError and Invalid File Path **COMPLETED**
- **Critical Bugs Fixed**: 
  1. `get_active_schedules()` called with user_id string instead of schedules dict -> `'str' object has no attribute 'items'` error
  2. `load_json_data()` received Path objects instead of strings -> "Invalid file_path" validation errors
- **Root Causes**: 
  1. Function expects dict but was receiving user_id string in user_context.py and context_manager.py
  2. Path objects from pathlib operations not converted to strings before passing to load_json_data()
- **Fixes**: 
  1. Added proper schedules retrieval using `get_user_data(user_id, 'schedules')` before calling `get_active_schedules()`
  2. Added `str()` conversion in channel_orchestrator.py: `load_json_data(str(file_path))`
- **Test Coverage**: Updated 2 tests for additional get_user_data call; all 75 related tests passing (schedule utilities, user context, file operations)
- **Impact**: User context and AI context generation work correctly; message loading from user files works; error logs no longer cluttered
- **Files**: user/user_context.py, user/context_manager.py, communication/core/channel_orchestrator.py, tests/behavior/test_user_context_behavior.py

### 2025-10-11 - Critical Async Error Handling Fix for Discord Message Receiving **COMPLETED**
- **Critical Bug Fixed**: Discord bot was not receiving messages due to `@handle_errors` decorator breaking async event handlers
- **Error**: "event registered must be a coroutine function" during Discord initialization
- **Root Cause**: `@handle_errors` decorator wrapped async functions in non-async wrappers, converting coroutine functions to regular functions
- **Fix**: Enhanced `@handle_errors` decorator to detect async functions and use async wrappers (`async def` + `await`)
- **Test Coverage**: Added 4 comprehensive async error handling tests verifying decorator works with async functions
- **System Stability**: All 1,848 tests passing (28 total error handling tests, 4 new async tests)
- **Impact**: Discord message receiving now works correctly, all async functions properly decorated
- **Files**: core/error_handling.py, tests/unit/test_error_handling.py

### 2025-10-11 - Check-in Flow State Persistence Bug Fix **COMPLETED**
- **Critical Bug Fixed**: Check-in flows were being expired when scheduled messages were checked, even when no message was sent
- **Root Cause**: System called "Completed message sending" after checking for messages, triggering flow expiration even when no message sent
- **Fix**: Only expire flows when message is actually sent successfully AND message is not a scheduled type (motivational, health, checkin, task_reminders)
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added comprehensive flow state lifecycle logging (`FLOW_STATE_CREATE`, `FLOW_STATE_SAVE`, `FLOW_STATE_LOAD`, `FLOW_STATE_EXPIRE`)
- **Discord Debugging**: Added message reception logging (`DISCORD_MESSAGE_RECEIVED`, `DISCORD_MESSAGE_USER_IDENTIFIED`)
- **Message Selection Debugging**: Added detailed logging to understand why message matching fails (`MESSAGE_SELECTION`, `MESSAGE_SELECTION_NO_MATCH`)
- **Impact**: Check-in flows now persist correctly through scheduled message checks; comprehensive debugging for two additional issues
- **Files**: communication/core/channel_orchestrator.py, communication/message_processing/conversation_flow_manager.py, communication/communication_channels/discord/bot.py

### 2025-10-11 - Test Suite Fixes: All 50 Failures Resolved **COMPLETED**
- **Achievement**: Fixed all 50 test failures from initial run - 100% success rate (1,844 passed, 1 skipped)
- **Major Fixes**: Path object handling (33 tests), error recovery metadata wrappers (33 tests), test expectations (2 tests), validation (2 tests)
- **Root Causes**: Type mismatches (Path vs string), error recovery creating wrong default structures, missing input validation
- **Key Changes**: convert Path to string in checkin_dynamic_manager.py, return empty list for log files in error_handling.py, add tags validation in task_management.py, prevent auto-creation of message files in file_operations.py
- **Impact**: Improved system robustness, better error handling, more reliable file operations
- **Files**: core/checkin_dynamic_manager.py, core/error_handling.py, core/message_management.py, core/file_operations.py, tasks/task_management.py, tests/behavior/test_response_tracking_behavior.py, tests/unit/test_file_operations.py, tests/test_error_handling_improvements.py, communication/command_handlers/base_handler.py
