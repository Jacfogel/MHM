Advanced Discord Command Automation Tests

This module provides additional automated testing for Discord command scenarios
beyond the basic 15 manual tests, covering advanced functionality and edge cases.

Tests cover:
- Advanced command interactions and workflows
- Performance and reliability testing
- Integration testing with real Discord features
- Error recovery and resilience testing
