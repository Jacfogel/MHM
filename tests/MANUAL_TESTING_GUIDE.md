## üöÄ Quick Reference

### **Automated Testing Coverage**
‚úÖ **Fully Automated**: All 7 UI dialog types, Discord commands, error handling, data persistence  
‚úÖ **Test Commands**: `python -m pytest tests/behavior/test_*automation* -v`

### **Manual Testing Focus**
1. **Visual Design** - Layout, styling, responsive design
2. **User Experience** - Usability, accessibility, workflow efficiency
3. **Performance** - Real-world performance under user conditions
4. **Integration** - External system interactions (Discord, email, etc.)
5. **Cross-Platform** - Different operating systems, screen sizes


### **Before Starting**
- [ ] Run automated tests first: `python -m pytest tests/behavior/test_*automation* -v`
- [ ] Run `python run_headless_service.py start` to ensure system starts
- [ ] Have a test user ready (or create one)
- [ ] Focus on visual and UX aspects not covered by automation
