# Channel Interaction Implementation Plan

## üéØ **OVERVIEW**

**Goal**: Implement comprehensive user interactions through communication channels (Discord, email, etc.) in a channel-neutral, modular way.

**Vision**: All user interactions can be performed through channels - no separate UI required for users.

**Primary Channel**: Discord (already partially implemented)
**Secondary Channels**: Email, Telegram (planned)

## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURE APPROACH**

### **Channel-Neutral Design**
- **BaseChannel Interface**: Abstract base class for all channels
- **ChannelFactory**: Factory pattern for creating channel instances
- **CommunicationManager**: Central coordinator for all channels
- **ConversationManager**: Handles conversation flows across all channels

### **Modular Interaction System**
- **Interaction Handlers**: Channel-neutral handlers for different interaction types
- **Command Parser**: Natural language command parsing
- **Response Generator**: Channel-appropriate response formatting
- **State Management**: User state tracking across channels

2. **System**: "Great! Let's check in on how you're feeling today. How's your mood right now?"
3. **User**: "Pretty good, maybe 7/10"
4. **System**: "That's good to hear! Did you eat breakfast today?"
5. **User**: "Yes"
6. **System**: "Excellent! Your check-in is complete. You've been consistent with breakfast this week!"

### **Profile Management Flow**
1. **User**: "Show me my profile"
2. **System**: "Here's your current profile:
   - Name: Julie
   - Preferred pronouns: she/her
   - Check-ins: Enabled (daily)
   - Tasks: 3 active, 12 completed
   - Last check-in: Today at 9:30 AM"
