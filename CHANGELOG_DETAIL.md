## 🗓️ Recent Changes (Most Recent First)

### 2025-08-07 - Check-in Flow Behavior Improvements & Stability Fixes ✅ **COMPLETED**

#### Summary
Improved conversational behavior around scheduled check-ins so later unrelated outbound messages (motivational/health/task reminders) will expire any pending check-in flow. This prevents later user replies (e.g., "complete task") from being misinterpreted as answers to the check-in questions. Added `/checkin` command and a clearer intro prompt. Also fixed a stability issue in the restart monitor loop.

#### Key Changes
- Conversation Manager
  - Added `/checkin` start trigger and clearer intro prompt
  - Added legacy aliases: `start_daily_checkin`, `FLOW_DAILY_CHECKIN`
  - On completion, uses legacy-compatible `store_daily_checkin_response` (also logged) for backward-compatibility in tests
- Communication Manager
  - Expires an active check-in when sending unrelated outbound messages
  - Restart monitor: iterate over a copy of channels to avoid "dictionary keys changed during iteration"
- Response Tracking
  - Added legacy shims for `get_recent_daily_checkins` and `store_daily_checkin_response`
  - Mapped legacy category `daily_checkin` to the new storage path

#### Tests
- Full suite: 591 passed, 1 skipped

#### Documentation
- Regenerated function registry and module dependencies

### 2025-08-07 - Enhanced Logging System with Component Separation ✅ **COMPLETED**

#### **Project Overview**
Successfully completed a comprehensive enhanced logging system implementation with component-based separation, organized directory structure, and systematic migration of all system components to use targeted logging. This project involved creating a modern logging infrastructure and updating 42 files across the entire codebase.

#### **Scope and Scale**
- **Total Files Updated**: 42 files across all system components
- **Component Types**: 6 component loggers (main, discord, ai, user_activity, errors, communication, channels, email, telegram)

- **Duration**: Completed in focused development session
- **Status**: ✅ **100% COMPLETED**

#### **Technical Implementation**

##### **Phase 1: Core Logging Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED**

##### **Phase 3: Testing and Validation ✅ COMPLETED**
- **Test Fixes**: Fixed 2 logger behavior test failures
  - Added missing `total_files` field to `get_log_file_info()` function
  - Fixed bug in `cleanup_old_logs()` function where dict was being passed to `os.path.exists()`
- **Test Verification**: All behavior tests passing (344 tests), all unit tests passing (140 tests)

- **Solution**: Added total files calculation and included `total_files` field in return value
- **Impact**: Logger behavior tests now pass completely

##### **Cleanup Function Bug - CRITICAL FIX**
- **Problem**: `cleanup_old_logs()` function failing due to dict being passed to `os.path.exists()`
- **Root Cause**: Variable name conflict where `backup_files` was used for both file paths and file info dicts
- **Solution**: Separated into `backup_file_paths` and `backup_file_info` variables
- **Impact**: Log cleanup functionality now works correctly

#### **Enhanced Logging Features**
- **Component-Specific Logs**: Each system component now has its own dedicated log file
- **Structured Data**: JSON-formatted metadata with log messages for better parsing
