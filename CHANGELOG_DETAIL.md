- Pylance errors in `core/user_data_handlers.py` due to undefined legacy save functions
- 25 test failures due to caching issues and file path inconsistencies
- Scripts directory disorganized with redundant files

#### **Root Cause Analysis**
- `save_user_data` function was calling legacy `save_user_*_data` functions that no longer existed
- Legacy loaders had caching that wasn't being cleared after new API saves
- File mapping used `'user_context'` but new API used `'context'`
- `save_json_data` returned `None` instead of `True` on success
- Scripts directory contained many redundant and outdated files

#### **Solutions Implemented**

**1. Fixed Pylance Errors**
- Updated `save_user_data` in `core/user_data_handlers.py` to use unified API directly
- Replaced legacy function calls with direct `save_json_data` and `get_user_file_path` usage
- Updated imports in UI and test files to use new API

**2. Fixed Caching Issues**
- Added cache clearing after successful data saves in `save_user_data`
- Imported and called `clear_user_caches(user_id)` from `core.user_management`
- Ensures legacy loaders return fresh data after saves

**3. Fixed File Path Inconsistencies**
- Updated `get_user_file_path` mapping in `core/config.py` to use `'context'` instead of `'user_context'`

- Updated `create_user_files` in `core/file_operations.py` to use `'context'` file type
- Updated test expectations to expect `context.json` instead of `user_context.json`

**4. Fixed Return Value Expectations**
- Updated `save_json_data` in `core/file_operations.py` to return `True` on success
- Added `default_return=False` to `@handle_errors` decorator
- Updated all file operations tests to expect `True` instead of `None`

**5. Scripts Directory Cleanup**
- Organized scripts into logical categories:
  - `scripts/migration/` - Data migration scripts
  - `scripts/testing/` - Testing and validation scripts
  - `scripts/testing/ai/` - AI-specific testing scripts
  - `scripts/debug/` - Debugging and troubleshooting scripts
  - `scripts/utilities/` - General utility scripts

### 2025-07-20 - Fixed Manual Enhancement Preservation in Module Dependencies Generator

**Bug Fix:**
- Fixed critical issue in `ai_tools/generate_module_dependencies.py` where manual enhancement content was being lost on subsequent runs
- Resolved section parsing logic that was incorrectly identifying module headers in the format `#### `module_name.py``
- Fixed dependency comparison logic that was incorrectly comparing imports vs. reverse dependencies
- Enhanced preservation logic to retain ANY content in manual enhancement sections, not just "Enhanced Purpose" markers

**Technical Implementation:**
- Fixed section parsing condition from `line.strip().endswith('.py')` to properly handle `#### `module_name.py`` format
- Updated `preserve_manual_enhancements()` function to preserve any non-placeholder content in manual enhancement sections
- Fixed `identify_modules_needing_enhancement()` function to use corrected section parsing logic
- Simplified dependency comparison to avoid false "dependencies changed" reports when no actual changes occur

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Section parsing was failing because it looked for lines ending with `.py` but module headers end with `` ` ``
- Dependency comparison was comparing imports (what a module imports) with reverse dependencies (what imports the module)
- Preservation logic was too restrictive, only preserving content with "Enhanced Purpose" markers

**Benefits:**
- Manual enhancement content is now properly preserved across multiple runs
- Script correctly identifies enhancement status (placeholder vs. enhanced content)
- No more false "dependencies changed" reports when running in rapid succession
- Stable and reliable documentation generation workflow

**Testing Results:**
- Verified that enhanced content is preserved through multiple regeneration cycles
- Confirmed that enhancement status is correctly reported (21 modules with placeholder content, 64 with current enhancements)
- Validated that the script shows consistent results on repeated runs without false change detection

### 2025-07-20 - Enhanced Automated Analysis for Documentation Tools

    - ‚úÖ **Test Framework**: 226 tests passing with 100% success rate
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Module Dependencies**: 0% documented (1160 imports across 133 files need documentation)
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Documentation Redundancy**: Significant overlap across 11 documentation files identified
  - **Actions Taken**:
    - ‚úÖ **Updated Status Indicators**: Fixed outdated "0% documentation coverage" references in UI_MIGRATION_PLAN.md and TESTING_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md
    - ‚úÖ **Created Consolidation Plan**: Developed DOCUMENTATION_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md to address redundancy
    - ‚úÖ **Updated MODULE_DEPENDENCIES.md**: Added note about audit findings and documentation gap
  - **Next Steps**: Implement documentation consolidation to reduce redundancy and improve organization
- **2025-07-18** ‚Äì Legacy-import purge completed: all runtime & test code now uses `core.user_data_handlers` and `core.user_data_validation`; full test-suite passes (244 ‚úÖ, 1 skipped) with zero legacy warnings.
- **2025-07-18** ‚Äì Fixed event-loop issue in `LegacyChannelWrapper`, restoring outbound message delivery.
- **2025-07-18 - Centralized User-Data Handlers & Circular-Import Fix ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Modularization**: Moved `get_user_data`, `save_user_data`, and `save_user_data_transaction` implementations into a new module `core/user_data_handlers.py`.  Added thin legacy wrappers in `core/user_management.py` that log warnings for remaining call-sites.
- **Import Cleanup**: Updated all core, UI, bot, and task modules to import the new handlers.  Tests and runtime code no longer depend on the legacy paths.
- **Circular Import Resolution**: Removed an early import of `core.user_data_handlers` inside `core/user_management` that created a circular-import during test collection.  Wrappers now perform lazy imports only when called.
- **Validation Hardened**: Re-implemented `core/user_data_manager.get_user_data_summary` to build its report dynamically from the data-loader registry, eliminating `KeyError` crashes on startup.
- **Legacy Warning Suppression**: Wrapper functions now log "LEGACY ‚Ä¶" only for external callers, preventing noise from internal self-calls.
- **Tests**: Entire suite passes (244 ‚úî / 1 skipped).  No circular-import errors remain.
- **Next Steps**: 1) Monitor logs for residual legacy warnings and migrate any stragglers. 2) Delete the wrappers once no runtime code relies on them.
- **2025-07-18** ‚Äì Centralized user-data API hardening:
  - **Stricter Validation & Unified Results**: `core.user_data_handlers.save_user_data` now returns a predictable `{data_type: bool}` map for *all* requested data-types and performs per-type validation without early exits.
  - **Atomic Behaviour Preserved**: Backup creation and index updates remain but now respect the new validation flow.
  - **New High-Level Helpers**: Added `update_user_account`, `update_user_preferences`, `update_user_context`, and `update_channel_preferences` to `core.user_data_handlers` so callers can bypass the legacy wrappers in `core.user_management`.
  - **Test Suite**: All 244 tests still pass ‚Äì no functional regressions.
  - **Next Steps**: 1) Update imports across modules to use the new helpers directly. 2) Remove legacy wrappers once logs show zero external callers for 24 h.

  - **Problem**: Dialog was saving empty or invalid contact info to account.json, triggering validation errors
  - **Solution**: Added validation checks before saving contact info - save all valid contact info fields, not just the selected channel
  - **Email Validation**: Only save email if it's valid (using `is_valid_email()`)
  - **Phone Validation**: Only save phone if it's valid (using `is_valid_phone()`)
  - **Discord Validation**: Only save discord ID if it's not empty
  - **All Fields Saved**: All valid contact info fields are now saved to account.json, regardless of which channel is selected
  - **Impact**: Eliminates validation errors from invalid contact info being saved to account file
- **Channel Structure Fix**: Fixed "channel is required and must be a dictionary" error
  - **Problem**: Channel structure wasn't being properly initialized in preferences
  - **Solution**: Ensure channel structure exists in preferences before saving
  - **Impact**: Eliminates channel structure validation errors
- **Validation Logic Fix**: Fixed validation to only validate fields being updated
  - **Problem**: Validation was requiring all account fields (internal_username, channel) even when only updating contact info
  - **Solution**: Modified validation logic to only validate fields that are actually being updated
  - **Impact**: Eliminates validation errors when updating only contact info or timezone
- **Validation Error Display**: Added user-friendly validation error messages
  - **Problem**: Dialog was silently accepting invalid data without showing validation errors
  - **Solution**: Added validation error collection and display before saving
  - **User Experience**: Users now see clear error messages for invalid email or phone formats
  - **Behavior**: Dialog shows validation errors and prevents saving until errors are fixed
- **Account Creator Dialog Fix**: Fixed dialog not closing after successful account creation
  - **Problem**: Dialog had overridden accept() method that prevented closing
  - **Solution**: Added close_dialog() method and updated validate_and_accept() to use it

- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Timezone reorganization fully implemented and tested

### 2025-07-16 - Account Creation Dialog Closing Issue Fix ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Dialog Closing Issue Resolved**: Fixed account creation dialog closing immediately when validation fails
  - **Problem**: Dialog was closing immediately when Save button was pressed, even before validation error popup appeared
  - **Root Cause**: `@handle_errors` decorator was treating validation errors as system errors and closing the dialog
  - **Solution**: Removed `@handle_errors` decorator from `validate_and_accept()` method and added specific error handling for actual account creation errors
  - **Impact**: Validation errors now show popup without closing the dialog, allowing users to fix errors and try again
- **Error Handling Improvement**: Added specific try-catch around account creation to handle actual system errors separately from validation errors
  - **Validation Errors**: Show error popup, keep dialog open
  - **System Errors**: Show error popup with details, keep dialog open
  - **Success**: Dialog remains open for creating additional accounts
- **Files Updated**: `ui/dialogs/account_creator_dialog.py` - Fixed validation and error handling logic

### 2025-07-16 - Account Creation Task/Check-in Settings Fix ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Task/Check-in Settings Save Fix**: Fixed account creation to properly save task and check-in settings to correct files
  - **Problem**: Task and check-in settings were not being saved because feature enablement information wasn't passed correctly to create_user_files
  - **Solution**: Added 'features_enabled' information to user_preferences passed to create_user_files
  - **Impact**: Task and check-in settings now properly save to preferences.json and schedules.json when features are enabled
- **Account Creation Dialog Closing Investigation**: Investigated why dialog closes after successful creation
  - **Problem**: Dialog closes after successful account creation even though it's not calling self.accept()
  - **Investigation**: Removed success message box that might have been causing the issue
  - **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **OUTSTANDING** - Dialog still closes, likely due to Qt framework behavior with signal emission
  - **Next Steps**: May need to delay signal emission or handle dialog lifecycle differently

### 2025-07-16 - Account Creation Contact Info & Validation Fixes ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Contact Info Collection Fix**: Fixed account creation to save all filled contact fields, not just the selected service
  - **Problem**: Only the contact info for the selected service was being saved, other fields were ignored
  - **Solution**: Updated contact info collection to read all fields from the channel widget and save non-empty values
  - **Impact**: All contact fields (email, phone, discord_id) are now properly saved when filled in
- **Phone Validation Added**: Added proper phone number validation for Telegram service
  - **Problem**: Phone field accepted letters without validation, just saved as blank
  - **Solution**: Added phone validation using existing `is_valid_phone()` function with clear error message
  - **Impact**: Users now get proper validation errors for invalid phone numbers
- **Task/Check-in Settings Cleanup**: Removed duplicate enabled flags from preferences.json
  - **Problem**: Task and check-in settings were being stored with `enabled: true` in preferences.json
  - **Solution**: Removed enabled flags from preferences.json since feature enablement is tracked in account.json
  - **Impact**: Cleaner data separation - feature enablement in account.json, settings in preferences.json
- **Contact Info Field Mapping Fix**: Fixed contact info field mapping in account creation
  - **Problem**: Contact info was using inconsistent field names ('telegram' vs 'phone')
  - **Solution**: Standardized on phone' field name for consistency
  - **Impact**: Contact info now properly maps to correct account fields
- **Files Updated**: `ui/dialogs/account_creator_dialog.py` - Fixed contact info collection, validation, and data mapping

### 2025-07-16 - Account Creation Data Fixes ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Features Field Format Fix**: Fixed account creation to save features in correct format
  - **Problem**: Features were being saved as boolean values instead of "enabled"/disabled" strings
  - **Solution**: Updated `create_account()` method to build proper features dict with string values
  - **Impact**: Account.json now correctly shows `"features": {"automated_messages":enabled, heckins":enabled, task_management": "enabled}`
- **Categories Warning Fix**: Fixed unnecessary warnings for users without automated messages
  - **Problem**: System was warning "No categories found" even when automated messages were disabled
  - **Solution**: Updated `update_message_references()` to check if automated messages are enabled before warning
  - **Impact**: No more false warnings for users who don't have automated messages enabled
- **Schedule Data Separation Fix**: Fixed schedule data being stored in wrong files
  - **Problem**: Schedule periods were being stored in both `schedules.json` and `preferences.json`
  - **Solution**: Updated `create_user_files()` to only store schedule periods in `schedules.json`
  - **Impact**: Clean separation of data - settings in preferences.json, schedules in schedules.json
- **Contact Info Persistence**: Contact info fields now properly save to account.json
  - **Status**: Contact info collection and saving logic is correct, issue may be with empty values when messages disabled
- **Validation Dialog Behavior**: Account creation dialog still closes after successful creation
  - **Status**: Dialog is not calling `self.accept()` but still closes - needs investigation
- **Files Updated**: `ui/dialogs/account_creator_dialog.py`, `core/user_data_manager.py`, `core/file_operations.py`

### 2025-07-16 - Critical Account Creation Data Loss Fix ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Root Cause Identified**: Account creation was using outdated `create_new_user()` function instead of primary `create_user_files()` method
  - **Problem**: `create_new_user()` created data structures but ignored most collected data, then `create_user_files()` was called with empty defaults
  - **Solution**: Updated account creation dialog to call `create_user_files()` directly with actual collected data
  - **Impact**: Account creation now properly saves all user selections (username, contact info, categories, settings, etc.)
  - **Files Updated**: `ui/dialogs/account_creator_dialog.py` - Fixed `create_account()` method to use correct data flow
- **Data Flow Correction**: 
  - **Before**: Dialog ‚Üí `create_new_user()` (ignores data) ‚Üí `create_user_files()` (empty defaults)
  - **After**: Dialog ‚Üí `create_user_files()` (actual data) ‚Üí User index update
- **Validation Dialog UX Fix**: Fixed validation error popups closing the account creation dialog
  - **Problem**: Validation error dialogs were non-modal and closed the main dialog
  - **Solution**: Made validation dialogs modal so users can return to fix errors
  - **Impact**: Better user experience - users can correct validation errors without losing their work
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Account creation now properly persists all user data and provides better UX

### 2025-07-16 - Dialog Testing & Status Correction ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

### 2025-06-11 - Initial Commit
- Initial commit: Mental Health Management (MHM) system

### 2025-07-20 - Incorporated Manual Enhancements from MODULE_DEPENDENCIES_MANUAL.md

**Major Enhancement:**
- Successfully extracted and incorporated detailed reverse dependency information from the manual documentation file
- Added comprehensive "Used by" information for 51 modules that were previously showing "None (not imported by other modules)"
- Enhanced the hybrid documentation approach by merging manual research with automated analysis

**Key Improvements:**

**Reverse Dependencies Added:**
- **Core Modules**: All core system modules now show their actual usage across the codebase
  - `core/error_handling.py`: 43 reverse dependencies (most used module)
  - `core/logger.py`: 52 reverse dependencies (most used module)
  - `core/config.py`: 24 reverse dependencies
  - `core/file_operations.py`: 26 reverse dependencies
  - `core/user_management.py`: 43 reverse dependencies
  - `core/user_data_handlers.py`: 23 reverse dependencies

**Bot Modules**: Communication channel modules now show their usage patterns
- `bot/base_channel.py`: 5 reverse dependencies (used by all bot implementations)
- `bot/ai_chatbot.py`: 2 reverse dependencies
- `bot/communication_manager.py`: 4 reverse dependencies

**UI Modules**: User interface components now show their integration points
- `ui/dialogs/account_creator_dialog.py`: 4 reverse dependencies
- `ui/dialogs/user_profile_dialog.py`: 5 reverse dependencies
- `ui/widgets/period_row_widget.py`: 5 reverse dependencies

**User Modules**: User data modules show their usage across the system
- `user/user_context.py`: 10 reverse dependencies
- `user/user_preferences.py`: 1 reverse dependency

**Technical Implementation:**
- Created `ai_tools/add_reverse_dependencies.py` script to extract and merge manual enhancements
- Script parses the manual file to extract "Used by" information for each module
- Automatically updates the current MODULE_DEPENDENCIES.md with accurate reverse dependency data
- Preserves all existing automated analysis while adding manual research findings

**Benefits:**
- **Complete Dependency Map**: Now shows both what each module depends on AND what depends on it
- **System Understanding**: Clear visibility into which modules are most critical to the system
- **Maintenance Insights**: Identifies modules that would have the most impact if changed
- **Architecture Validation**: Confirms that core modules are properly used throughout the system

**Current Status:**
- **51 modules** now have accurate reverse dependency information
- **Most used modules** identified: `core/logger.py` (52 users), `core/error_handling.py` (43 users)
- **Complete dependency graph** now available for system analysis and maintenance

### 2025-07-28 - Schedule Format Consistency & Legacy Code Management

#### **Schedule Period Naming Standardization** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Problem**: Inconsistent period naming between Task Management and Check-in Management dialogs
  - Task periods used title case: "Task Reminder Default", "Task Reminder 2"
  - Check-in periods used lowercase: "check-in reminder default", "check-in reminder 2"
- **Solution**: Standardized all auto-generated period names to use title case
  - Updated `create_default_schedule_periods()` in `core/user_management.py` to use title case
  - Updated `add_new_time_period()` in `ui/widgets/checkin_settings_widget.py` to use "Check-in Reminder Default" and "Check-in Reminder {number}"
  - Both dialogs now generate consistent title case names
- **Impact**: Improved user experience with consistent, professional-looking period names
- **Files Modified**: `core/user_management.py`, `ui/widgets/checkin_settings_widget.py`

#### **Schedule Structure Cleanup** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Problem**: Schedules dictionary included unnecessary "enabled" field that served no purpose
- **Solution**: Removed "enabled" field from all schedule creation and management functions
  - Updated `set_schedule_periods()` in `core/schedule_management.py`
  - Updated `migrate_legacy_schedules_structure()` and `ensure_category_has_default_schedule()` in `core/user_management.py`
  - Updated `create_user_files()` in `core/file_operations.py`
- **Impact**: Cleaner data structure without redundant fields
- **Files Modified**: `core/schedule_management.py`, `core/user_management.py`, `core/file_operations.py`

#### **Legacy Code Management** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Problem**: Legacy compatibility code was scattered throughout the codebase without clear marking or removal plans
- **Solution**: Comprehensive audit and marking of all legacy code
  - Identified legacy format handling in schedule management functions
  - Marked all legacy code with clear `LEGACY COMPATIBILITY` comments and removal plans
  - Created `LEGACY_CODE_REMOVAL_PLAN.md` with detailed inventory and removal steps
  - Verified all user data uses modern format (periods wrapper)
- **Impact**: Clear roadmap for legacy code removal, improved code maintainability
- **Files Modified**: `core/schedule_management.py`, `LEGACY_CODE_REMOVAL_PLAN.md`

#### **Code Cleanup** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
