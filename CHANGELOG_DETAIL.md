## üóìÔ∏è Recent Changes (Most Recent First)

### 2025-08-07 - Check-in Flow Behavior Improvements & Stability Fixes ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

#### Summary
Improved conversational behavior around scheduled check-ins so later unrelated outbound messages (motivational/health/task reminders) will expire any pending check-in flow. This prevents later user replies (e.g., "complete task") from being misinterpreted as answers to the check-in questions. Added `/checkin` command and a clearer intro prompt. Also fixed a stability issue in the restart monitor loop.

#### Key Changes
- Conversation Manager
  - Added `/checkin` start trigger and clearer intro prompt
  - Added legacy aliases: `start_daily_checkin`, `FLOW_DAILY_CHECKIN`
  - On completion, uses legacy-compatible `store_daily_checkin_response` (also logged) for backward-compatibility in tests
- Communication Manager
  - Expires an active check-in when sending unrelated outbound messages
  - Restart monitor: iterate over a copy of channels to avoid "dictionary keys changed during iteration"
- Response Tracking
  - Added legacy shims for `get_recent_daily_checkins` and `store_daily_checkin_response`
  - Mapped legacy category `daily_checkin` to the new storage path

#### Tests
- Full suite: 591 passed, 1 skipped

#### Documentation
- Regenerated function registry and module dependencies

### 2025-08-07 - Enhanced Logging System with Component Separation ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

#### **Project Overview**
Successfully completed a comprehensive enhanced logging system implementation with component-based separation, organized directory structure, and systematic migration of all system components to use targeted logging. This project involved creating a modern logging infrastructure and updating 42 files across the entire codebase.

#### **Scope and Scale**
- **Total Files Updated**: 42 files across all system components
- **Component Types**: 6 component loggers (main, discord, ai, user_activity, errors, communication, channels, email, telegram)
