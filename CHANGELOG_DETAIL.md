## 🗓️ Recent Changes (Most Recent First)

### 2025-08-11 - Discord Task Edit Flow Improvements, Suggestion Relevance, Windows Path Compatibility, and File Auditor Relocation
#### Summary
Improved the Discord task edit experience by suppressing irrelevant suggestions on targeted prompts and making the prompt examples actionable. Enhanced the command parser to recognize "due date ..." phrasing. Fixed Windows path issues for default messages and config validation. Moved the file creation auditor to `ai_tools` and integrated it as a developer diagnostic.

#### Key Changes
- Interaction Manager
  - Do not auto-append generic suggestions on incomplete `update_task` prompts
- Interaction Handlers (Tasks)
  - When updates are missing but task identified, return specific examples and do not attach generic suggestions
  - Limit list-tasks suggestions to relevant contexts
- Enhanced Command Parser
  - `_extract_update_entities`: handle both "due ..." and "due date ..." patterns
- Config & Message Management (Windows)
  - Force `DEFAULT_MESSAGES_DIR_PATH` to relative in tests; normalized path handling when loading defaults
  - Simplified directory creation logic for Windows path separators
- Developer Diagnostics
  - Moved file auditor to `ai_tools/file_auditor.py`; start/stop wired from service; programmatic `record_created` used in file ops and service utilities

#### Tests
- Fixed 3 failures on Windows (default messages path and directory creation); targeted tests now pass
- Full suite: 638 passed, 2 skipped

#### Impact
- Clear, actionable edit prompts and fewer irrelevant suggestions
- Reliable default message loading and directory creation on Windows
- Cleaner separation of diagnostics tools from core runtime

### 2025-08-10 - Channel-Agnostic Command Registry, Discord Slash Commands, and Flow Routing
#### Summary
Created a single source of truth for channel-agnostic commands with flow metadata and wired Discord to use it for both true slash commands and classic commands. Updated interaction routing to send flow-marked slash commands to the conversation flow engine. Added scaffolds for future flows to keep architecture consistent.

#### Key Changes
- Interaction Manager
  - Introduced `CommandDefinition` with `name`, `mapped_message`, `description`, and `is_flow`
  - Centralized `_command_definitions` list and derived `slash_command_map`
  - Exposed `get_slash_command_map()` and `get_command_definitions()` for channels to consume
  - Updated `handle_message()` to:
    - Handle `/cancel` universally via `ConversationManager`
    - Delegate flow-marked slash commands (currently `checkin`) to `ConversationManager`
    - Map known non-flow slash commands to single-turn handlers
    - For unknown `/` or `!` commands: strip prefix and parse using `EnhancedCommandParser`, fallback to contextual chat
- Discord Bot
  - Registers true slash commands (`app_commands`) dynamically from `get_command_definitions()`; syncs on ready
  - Registers classic `!` commands dynamically from the same list, skipping `help` to avoid duplicating Discord's native help
  - Removed bespoke static command handlers replaced by dynamic registration
- Conversation Manager
  - Added scaffolds: `start_tasks_flow`, `start_profile_flow`, `start_schedule_flow`, `start_messages_flow`, `start_analytics_flow` (currently delegate to single-turn behavior)

#### Tests
- Full suite green: 632 passed, 2 skipped

#### Impact
- Clear, channel-agnostic command registry
- Consistent discoverability on Discord via real slash commands and optional classic commands
- Architecture ready to expand additional stateful flows beyond check-in

### 2025-08-10 - Plans/TODO Consolidation, Backup Retention, and Test Log Hygiene ✅

#### Summary
Standardized documentation boundaries between plans and tasks, implemented backup retention and test artifact pruning, and verified system health.

#### Key Changes
- Documentation
  - Split independent tasks (TODO.md) vs grouped plans (PLANS.md); removed completed plan blocks from PLANS.md and pointed to changelogs
  - Moved plan-worthy items into PLANS.md: UI testing follow-ups, UI quality improvements, Discord hardening, message data reorg, `UserPreferences` refactor, dynamic check-in questions
- Test artifact hygiene
  - Added auto-prune to `tests/conftest.py` for test logs (>14d) and test backups (>7d), with env overrides
- Backup retention
  - `core/backup_manager.py`: added age-based retention via `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30d) in addition to count-based retention
  - Added CLI: `scripts/utilities/cleanup/cleanup_backups.py` to prune by age/count on demand

#### Tests
- Full suite green: 595 passed, 1 skipped

#### Audit
- Comprehensive audit successful; documentation coverage ~99%

### 2025-08-09 - Test Data Isolation Hardening & Config Import Safety ✅

#### Summary
Prevented test artifacts from appearing under real `data/users` and removed fragile from-imports of config constants in key modules.

#### Key Changes
- Test isolation
  - Stopped early environment overrides of `BASE_DATA_DIR`/`USER_INFO_DIR_PATH` that broke default-constant tests
  - Kept isolation via session-scoped fixture that patches `core.config` attributes to `tests/data/users`
  - Updated `tests/unit/test_file_operations.py` lifecycle test to assert no writes to real `data/users`
- Import safety
  - `core/backup_manager.py`: switched to `import core.config as cfg` and updated all references
  - `ui/ui_app_qt.py`: switched selected references to `cfg.*` and fixed linter warnings

#### Tests
- Full suite: 632 passed, 2 skipped

### 2025-08-09 - Logging Architecture Finalization & Test Isolation ✅

#### Summary
Completed component-first logging migration across bot modules, finalized orchestration logger naming, and ensured tests cannot write to real logs.

#### Key Changes
- Bot modules: `interaction_manager`, `interaction_handlers`, `ai_chatbot`, `enhanced_command_parser`, `user_context_manager`
  - Switched from module loggers to component loggers (`communication_manager`, `ai`, `user_activity`)
- Test isolation
  - In `MHM_TESTING=1` and `TEST_VERBOSE_LOGS=1`, all component logs (including `errors`) remap under `tests/logs/`
  - Prevents tests from writing to `logs/*.log`
- Manual async script
  - `scripts/test_discord_connection.py` is now skipped in pytest (manual diagnostic tool); TODO added to migrate to `pytest-asyncio`
- Documentation
  - `logs/LOGGING_GUIDE.md` updated with BaseChannel pattern and test isolation behavior

#### Tests
- Full suite: 629 passed, 2 skipped


### 2025-08-07 - Check-in Flow Behavior Improvements & Stability Fixes ✅ **COMPLETED**

#### Summary
Improved conversational behavior around scheduled check-ins so later unrelated outbound messages (motivational/health/task reminders) will expire any pending check-in flow. This prevents later user replies (e.g., "complete task") from being misinterpreted as answers to the check-in questions. Added `/checkin` command and a clearer intro prompt. Also fixed a stability issue in the restart monitor loop.

#### Key Changes
- Conversation Manager
  - Added `/checkin` start trigger and clearer intro prompt
  - Added legacy aliases: `start_daily_checkin`, `FLOW_DAILY_CHECKIN`
  - On completion, uses legacy-compatible `store_daily_checkin_response` (also logged) for backward-compatibility in tests
- Communication Manager
  - Expires an active check-in when sending unrelated outbound messages
  - Restart monitor: iterate over a copy of channels to avoid "dictionary keys changed during iteration"
- Response Tracking
  - Added legacy shims for `get_recent_daily_checkins` and `store_daily_checkin_response`
  - Mapped legacy category `daily_checkin` to the new storage path

#### Tests
- Full suite: 591 passed, 1 skipped

#### Documentation
- Regenerated function registry and module dependencies

### 2025-08-07 - Enhanced Logging System with Component Separation ✅ **COMPLETED**

#### **Project Overview**

- **Solution**: Added total files calculation and included `total_files` field in return value
- **Impact**: Logger behavior tests now pass completely

##### **Cleanup Function Bug - CRITICAL FIX**
- **Problem**: `cleanup_old_logs()` function failing due to dict being passed to `os.path.exists()`
- **Root Cause**: Variable name conflict where `backup_files` was used for both file paths and file info dicts
- **Solution**: Separated into `backup_file_paths` and `backup_file_info` variables
- **Impact**: Log cleanup functionality now works correctly

#### **Enhanced Logging Features**
- **Component-Specific Logs**: Each system component now has its own dedicated log file
- **Structured Data**: JSON-formatted metadata with log messages for better parsing
