### 2025-09-01 - Admin Panel UI Layout Improvements ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Objective**: Redesign the admin panel UI for consistent, professional appearance with uniform button layouts across all management sections.

**Background**: The admin panel had inconsistent button layouts with different sections having varying numbers of buttons per row, inconsistent sizing, and poor alignment. The Refresh button was redundant, and scheduler buttons were poorly positioned.

**Implementation Details**:

#### **Service Management Section Improvements**
- **Removed Refresh Button**: Eliminated redundant refresh functionality that was rarely used
- **Repositioned Run Full Scheduler**: Moved from separate row to main button row (position 4)
- **Layout**: Now has clean 4-button row: Start Service | Stop Service | Restart | Run Full Scheduler

#### **User Management Section Redesign**
- **Expanded to 4 Buttons Wide**: Changed from 3-button to 4-button layout for consistency
- **Added User Analytics Button**: Placeholder for future analytics functionality
- **Improved Layout**: Now has 1.75 rows as requested:
  - Row 1: Communication Settings | Personalization | Category Management | User Analytics
  - Row 2: Check-in Settings | Task Management | Task CRUD | Run User Scheduler
- **Left Alignment**: All buttons properly aligned to the left

#### **Category Management Section Improvements**

### 2025-08-30 - Critical Test Isolation Issues Investigation and Resolution ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Objective**: Investigate and resolve critical test isolation issues where tests were failing in the full test suite due to fixture dependency conflicts and global state interference.

**Background**: Tests were passing when run individually or in small groups, but failing when run as part of the full test suite. The issue was related to `get_user_data()` returning empty dictionaries `{}` instead of expected test data, indicating that the `mock_config` fixture was not being applied correctly across all tests.

**Implementation Details**:

#### **Root Cause Analysis**
- **Primary Issue**: Fixture dependency conflicts in pytest where `mock_config` fixture with `autouse=True` was interfering with other fixtures
- **Secondary Issue**: Some behavior tests were directly assigning to `core.config` attributes, bypassing fixture patching
- **Tertiary Issue**: Multiple `autouse=True` fixtures were creating conflicts in the dependency chain

#### **Configuration Patching Fix** (`tests/conftest.py`)
- **Root Cause**: `mock_config` fixture was using incorrect patching method (`patch('core.config...')` instead of `patch.object(core.config, ...)`)
- **Solution**: Updated fixture to use `patch.object(core.config, 'VAR_NAME')` for proper module-level constant patching
- **Implementation**: Modified `mock_config` fixture to correctly patch `BASE_DATA_DIR`, `USER_INFO_DIR_PATH`, and `DEFAULT_MESSAGES_DIR_PATH`
- **Impact**: Tests now properly use test data directories instead of real user data

#### **Fixture Dependency Resolution** (`tests/conftest.py`)
- **Root Cause**: `mock_config` fixture with `autouse=True` was causing conflicts with other fixtures and tests
- **Solution**: Removed `autouse=True` from `mock_config` fixture to prevent interference
- **Implementation**: Made fixture explicit (requires explicit parameter in test functions)
- **Impact**: Eliminated fixture conflicts and improved test isolation

#### **Behavior Test Cleanup** (`tests/behavior/test_account_management_real_behavior.py`, `tests/behavior/test_utilities_demo.py`)
- **Root Cause**: Tests were directly assigning to `core.config.DATA_DIR`, bypassing fixture patching
- **Solution**: Removed direct config assignments and relied on `mock_config` fixture
- **Implementation**: Commented out direct assignments and added explanatory comments
- **Impact**: Tests now properly use mocked configuration

#### **Integration Test Consistency** (`tests/integration/test_account_lifecycle.py`)
- **Root Cause**: Integration tests were manually overriding config values, conflicting with `mock_config` fixture
- **Solution**: Removed manual config overrides and relied on fixture
- **Implementation**: Modified `setup_test_environment` fixture to remove manual overrides
- **Impact**: Integration tests now use consistent configuration patching

#### **UI Test Fixes** (`tests/ui/test_dialogs.py`, `tests/unit/test_schedule_management.py`)
- **Root Cause**: Some tests were not explicitly requesting `mock_config` fixture
- **Solution**: Added `mock_config` parameter to test function signatures
- **Implementation**: Updated test functions to explicitly request the fixture
- **Impact**: Tests now properly use mocked configuration

**Investigation Methodology**:
- **Systematic Testing**: Ran failing tests in isolation, small groups, and various combinations
- **Fixture Debugging**: Created debug tests to verify fixture dependency resolution
- **Scope Analysis**: Investigated fixture scoping (`session` vs `function`) and dependency chains
- **Conflict Detection**: Identified tests with direct config assignments and `autouse=True` conflicts

**Testing Results**:
- **Individual Tests**: All tests pass when run individually
- **Small Groups**: Tests pass when run in small groups (51/51, 53/53, 335/335 tests)
- **Full Suite**: Tests now pass consistently in full test suite execution
- **Fixture Isolation**: Proper test isolation achieved across all test types

**Key Technical Insights**:
- **Patching Method**: `patch.object()` is required for module-level constants, `patch()` doesn't work
- **Fixture Conflicts**: Multiple `autouse=True` fixtures can interfere with each other
- **Global State**: Direct config assignments can persist across test runs
- **Dependency Chains**: Fixture dependencies must be carefully managed to avoid conflicts

**Benefits Achieved**:
- **Test Reliability**: Tests now pass consistently in all execution scenarios

**Objective**: Fix critical test hanging issues, logger patching problems, and improve integration test consistency with system architecture after git rollback.

**Background**: After rolling back changes to two git commits ago, tests were hanging and creating popup windows. Additionally, error handling tests were failing due to logger patching issues, and integration tests were not properly aligned with the actual system architecture.

**Implementation Details**:

#### **Test Hanging Fix** (`tests/conftest.py`)
- **Root Cause**: QMessageBox popups were appearing during test execution, causing tests to hang
- **Solution**: Added global QMessageBox patches in conftest.py to prevent real popup dialogs
- **Implementation**: Created `setup_qmessagebox_patches()` function to mock all QMessageBox static methods
- **Impact**: Tests no longer hang due to popup dialogs

#### **Logger Patching Fix** (`tests/unit/test_error_handling.py`)

- **Solution**: Updated tests to patch `core.logger.get_component_logger` instead of non-existent global logger
- **Implementation**: Modified all test methods to use proper logger patching approach
- **Impact**: Error handling tests now pass consistently

#### **Integration Test Consistency** (`tests/integration/test_account_lifecycle.py`)
- **Root Cause**: Integration tests used directory scanning to find user UUIDs instead of proper system lookups
- **Solution**: Updated tests to use `get_user_id_by_identifier` for proper system consistency
- **Implementation**: Modified test methods to use proper user index lookups
- **Impact**: Tests now align with actual system architecture

#### **TestUserFactory Enhancement** (`tests/test_utilities.py`)

### 2025-08-27 - Circular Import Fix and Test Coverage Expansion ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Objective**: Fix critical circular import issue preventing system startup and expand test coverage with focus on real behavior testing.

**Background**: A circular import between `core/config.py` and `core/error_handling.py` was preventing `run_mhm.py` from starting. Additionally, several test suites were failing due to mismatched expectations with actual system behavior.

**Implementation Details**:

#### **Circular Import Resolution** (`core/error_handling.py`)
- **Root Cause**: `core/config.py` imports from `core/error_handling.py`, which imports from `core/logger.py`, which imports from `core/config.py`
- **Solution**: Moved all logger imports in `core/error_handling.py` to local scope within functions that need them

### 2025-08-25 - Additional Code Quality Improvements ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Overview**: Implemented additional code quality improvements addressing advanced suggestions for cache consistency, throttler behavior, dataclass modernization, and dependency cleanup. These changes improve system reliability, performance, and maintainability.

**Issues Addressed**:

1. **Cache Key Consistency Enhancement**:
   - **Problem**: Cache operations were inconsistent, some using f-string keys while others relied on cache's internal keying
   - **Impact**: Potential cache misses and duplicate entries due to inconsistent key generation
   - **Solution**: 
     - Replaced `_make_cache_key()` with `_make_cache_key_inputs()` for better separation of concerns
     - Updated all cache operations to use the existing `prompt_type` parameter consistently
     - Added specific prompt types for "personalized", "contextual", and mode-based caching
   - **Files Modified**: `ai/chatbot.py`

2. **Throttler First-Run Fix**:
   - **Problem**: Throttler's first call to `should_run()` returned `True` but didn't set `last_run`, causing immediate subsequent calls to also return `True`
   - **Impact**: Throttling didn't work properly on first use, allowing rapid successive calls
   - **Solution**: Modified `should_run()` to set `last_run` timestamp on first call, ensuring proper throttling from the start
   - **Files Modified**: `core/service_utilities.py`

3. **Dataclass Modernization**:
   - **Problem**: `CacheEntry` used `__post_init__` to handle default `metadata` initialization
   - **Impact**: More boilerplate code and potential for None-related issues
   - **Solution**: Replaced with `field(default_factory=dict)` for cleaner, more idiomatic dataclass usage
   - **Files Modified**: `ai/cache_manager.py`

4. **Dependency Cleanup**:
   - **Problem**: `tkcalendar` was listed in requirements.txt but not used anywhere in the codebase
   - **Impact**: Unnecessary dependency bloat and slower installation
   - **Solution**: Removed unused `tkcalendar` dependency from requirements.txt
   - **Files Modified**: `requirements.txt`

**Technical Details**:

**Cache Improvements**:
- **Before**: Mixed cache key strategies with potential for cache misses
- **After**: Consistent use of `prompt_type` parameter across all cache operations
- **Impact**: Better cache hit rates and reduced duplicate entries

**Throttler Fix**:
- **Before**: First call didn't set timestamp, allowing immediate subsequent calls
- **After**: First call sets timestamp, ensuring proper throttling from the start
- **Impact**: Proper time-based throttling behavior

**Dataclass Enhancement**:
- **Before**: Manual None checking in `__post_init__`
- **After**: Automatic default value handling with `default_factory`
- **Impact**: Cleaner code and better type safety

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ All fast tests pass (139 passed, 1 skipped)
- ✅ System startup successful
- ✅ Throttler test updated to reflect correct behavior

### 2025-08-25 - Comprehensive Code Quality Improvements ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Overview**: Implemented comprehensive code quality improvements addressing multiple issues identified in the codebase review. These changes improve maintainability, consistency, and reliability while eliminating potential bugs and improving code organization.

**Issues Addressed**:

1. **Method Name Typo Fix**:
   - **Problem**: `__init____test_lm_studio_connection()` had four underscores instead of two
   - **Impact**: Made grepping/logging harder and risked confusion for tooling/refactors
   - **Solution**: Renamed to `_test_lm_studio_connection()` and updated all call sites
   - **Files Modified**: `ai/chatbot.py`

2. **Response Cache Key Inconsistency**:
   - **Problem**: Ad-hoc f-string cache keys (`f"{mode}:{user_prompt}"`) used inconsistently
   - **Impact**: Potential cache misses and duplicates due to inconsistent key formats
   - **Solution**: Added `_make_cache_key()` helper method for consistent key generation
   - **Format**: `{user_id}:{mode}:{prompt}` format for all cache operations
   - **Files Modified**: `ai/chatbot.py`

3. **Word/Character Limit Mismatch**:
   - **Problem**: Config used character limits but prompts mixed "words" and "characters"
   - **Impact**: Inconsistent truncation behavior and style drift
   - **Solution**: Enhanced `_smart_truncate_response()` to support both character and word limits
   - **Environment Variable**: Added `AI_MAX_RESPONSE_WORDS` for word-based limits
   - **Prompt Update**: Changed from "maximum 150 characters" to "under 150 words"
   - **Token Estimation**: Improved from `//4` to `//3` for more generous allocation
   - **Files Modified**: `ai/chatbot.py`

4. **Import and Legacy Code Issues**:
   - **Problem**: Duplicate `get_user_file_path` import in `core/response_tracking.py`
   - **Problem**: Legacy alias that called itself (infinite recursion risk)
   - **Problem**: Unused `hashlib` import in `ai/chatbot.py`
   - **Problem**: Incorrect header comment (`bot/ai_chatbot.py` vs `ai/chatbot.py`)
   - **Solution**: Cleaned up all imports and removed legacy code
   - **Files Modified**: `core/response_tracking.py`, `ai/chatbot.py`

5. **Encapsulation Issues**:
   - **Problem**: External code accessing `PromptManager` private fields directly
   - **Impact**: Broke encapsulation and coupled callers to internal implementation
   - **Solution**: Added getter methods: `has_custom_prompt()`, `custom_prompt_length()`, `fallback_prompt_keys()`
   - **Files Modified**: `ai/prompt_manager.py`, `ai/chatbot.py`

6. **Documentation Accuracy**:
   - **Problem**: `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` still mentioned Tkinter instead of PySide6
   - **Solution**: Updated to reflect current PySide6/Qt implementation
   - **Files Modified**: `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

**Changes Made**:

**`ai/chatbot.py`**:
```python
# Fixed method name typo
def _test_lm_studio_connection(self):  # was __init____test_lm_studio_connection

# Added cache key helper
def _make_cache_key(self, mode: str, prompt: str, user_id: Optional[str]) -> str:
    base = f"{mode}:{prompt}"
    return f"{user_id}:{base}" if user_id else base

# Enhanced truncation with word support
def _smart_truncate_response(self, text: str, max_chars: int, max_words: int = None) -> str:
    if max_words:
        words = text.split()
        if len(words) > max_words:
            return " ".join(words[:max_words]).rstrip(" ,.;:!?") + "…"
    # ... rest of implementation

# Updated token estimation
max_tokens = min(200, max(50, AI_MAX_RESPONSE_LENGTH // 3))  # was // 4

# Updated prompt guidance
"CRITICAL: Keep responses SHORT - under 150 words"  # was "maximum 150 characters"
```

**`ai/prompt_manager.py`**:
```python
# Added getter methods for encapsulation
def has_custom_prompt(self) -> bool:
    return self._custom_prompt is not None

def custom_prompt_length(self) -> int:
    return len(self._custom_prompt or "")

def fallback_prompt_keys(self) -> list[str]:
    return list(self._fallback_prompts.keys()) if isinstance(self._fallback_prompts, dict) else []
```

**`core/response_tracking.py`**:
```python
# Fixed duplicate imports
from core.file_operations import load_json_data, save_json_data, get_user_file_path
from core.config import USER_INFO_DIR_PATH, ensure_user_directory  # removed duplicate get_user_file_path

# Removed infinite recursion risk
# DELETED: Legacy alias that called itself
```

**`QUICK_REFERENCE.md`**:
```markdown
# Updated UI troubleshooting
- **Solution**: Ensure PySide6 is installed for Qt interface  # was "Try the modern Qt interface instead of legacy Tkinter"
```

**Verification**: 
- ✅ All fast tests pass without errors
- ✅ No logging errors during test execution
- ✅ Improved code maintainability and consistency
- ✅ Better separation of concerns and encapsulation
- ✅ Enhanced reliability and reduced potential for bugs

**Impact**: These improvements significantly enhance code quality, maintainability, and reliability while eliminating potential bugs and improving consistency across the codebase.

### 2025-08-25 - Logging Error Fix During Test Execution ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Problem**: During test execution, the logging system was encountering `PermissionError` when trying to rotate log files. The error occurred because Windows file locking prevented the logger from renaming log files that were still being used by other processes.

**Root Cause**: The logger's `doRollover()` method was being called during test execution, attempting to rotate log files (e.g., `errors.log` → `errors.2025-08-24.log`), but the files were locked by other processes in the test environment.

**Solution**: Implemented a multi-layer approach to disable log rotation during tests:

1. **Environment Variable Control**: Added `DISABLE_LOG_ROTATION=1` environment variable
2. **Multi-Layer Protection**: Set the environment variable in three key locations:
   - `run_tests.py` - For test runner execution
   - `pytest.ini` - For all pytest runs
   - `tests/conftest.py` - For test fixture setup

**Changes Made**:

**`run_tests.py`**:
```python
# Set test environment variables
os.environ['DISABLE_LOG_ROTATION'] = '1'  # Prevent log rotation issues during tests
```

**`pytest.ini`**:
```ini
# Test environment
# Disable log rotation during tests to prevent file locking issues
env = 
    DISABLE_LOG_ROTATION=1
```

**`tests/conftest.py`**:
```python
os.environ['DISABLE_LOG_ROTATION'] = '1'  # Prevent log rotation issues during tests
```

**Verification**: 
- ✅ All tests now run without logging errors
- ✅ No impact on production logging functionality  
- ✅ Maintains test isolation and reliability
- ✅ Fast test suite passes without errors
- ✅ Full test suite runs cleanly

**Impact**: Eliminates logging errors that could mask real test failures and improves test reliability on Windows systems.

### 2025-08-25 - Test Isolation and Category Validation Issues Resolution ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Test Isolation Fix:**
- **Problem**: `test_dialog_instantiation` in `tests/ui/test_dialogs.py` was setting `CATEGORIES` environment variable to `["general", "health", "tasks"]` which persisted across test runs and affected subsequent tests
- **Root Cause**: Environment variables are shared across the test process, and the test was not cleaning up after itself
- **Solution**: Added proper cleanup in `finally` block to restore original environment variable state
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added `original_categories = os.environ.get('CATEGORIES')` to save original state
  - Added `finally` block to restore original environment variable or remove it if it didn't exist
  - Updated CATEGORIES value to match `.env` file: `["motivational", "health", "quotes_to_ponder", "word_of_the_day", "fun_facts"]`

**Category Validation Alignment:**
- **Problem**: Tests were using hardcoded categories like `["general", "health", "tasks"]` that didn't match the actual system configuration
- **Root Cause**: Tests were written with assumptions about categories that didn't align with the `.env` file configuration
- **Solution**: Updated all tests to use the correct categories from the `.env` file
- **Changes Made**:
  - Updated `test_update_user_preferences_success` to use `["motivational", "health"]` instead of `["general", "health", "tasks"]`
  - Updated `test_user_lifecycle` to use correct categories throughout all assertions
  - Fixed test assertions to expect `["motivational", "health"]` instead of `["general", "health"]`

**Test Suite Stability:**
- **Before**: 2 failing tests due to environment variable pollution and category validation mismatches
- **After**: All 883 tests passing with consistent results
- **Impact**: Tests now run reliably regardless of execution order

**Files Modified**:
- `tests/ui/test_dialogs.py` - Added environment variable cleanup
- `tests/unit/test_user_management.py` - Updated category expectations and assertions

**Testing**: 
- All tests pass when run individually
- All tests pass when run in full suite
- No more flaky test behavior due to environment pollution

**Audit Results**:
- Documentation coverage: 100.1%
- Function registry: 1906 total functions, 1434 high complexity
- No critical issues identified
- System ready for continued development

### 2025-08-24 - AI Chatbot Additional Improvements and Code Quality Enhancements ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Single Owner of Prompts Implementation:**
- **Problem**: Fallback prompts existed in two places - `SystemPromptLoader` in `ai/chatbot.py` and `PromptManager` templates, creating maintenance burden and potential drift
- **Root Cause**: Code duplication between `SystemPromptLoader` and `PromptManager` classes
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate `SystemPromptLoader` class entirely and migrated all functionality to use `PromptManager` from `ai/prompt_manager.py`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed `SystemPromptLoader` class from `ai/chatbot.py` (lines 47-111)
  - Updated global instance from `system_prompt_loader = SystemPromptLoader()` to `prompt_manager = get_prompt_manager()`
  - Changed all method calls from `system_prompt_loader.get_system_prompt()` to `prompt_manager.get_prompt()`
  - Updated `reload_system_prompt()` to call `prompt_manager.reload_custom_prompt()`
  - Updated test methods to use `prompt_manager` instead of `system_prompt_loader`
- **Impact**: Single source of truth for all AI prompts, eliminated code duplication and potential inconsistencies

**Tests Alignment and Migration:**
- **Problem**: Tests were constructing `SystemPromptLoader` directly, creating disconnect between what's tested and what's used in production
- **Solution**: Migrated tests to target `PromptManager` directly and updated all references
- **Changes Made**:
  - Renamed `test_system_prompt_loader_creates_actual_file` to `test_prompt_manager_creates_actual_file`
  - Updated test to import and use `PromptManager` directly from `ai.prompt_manager`
  - Updated mock patches to target `ai.prompt_manager` instead of `ai.chatbot`
  - Updated `ResponseCache` tests to use `get_response_cache()` from `ai.cache_manager`
  - Removed imports of removed classes (`SystemPromptLoader`, `ResponseCache`)
- **Impact**: Tests now verify actual production code paths, improved test reliability

**Response Truncation Polish:**
- **Problem**: Character limits could cause mid-sentence truncation, making responses feel abrupt and unnatural
- **Solution**: Implemented smart truncation that tries to truncate at sentence boundaries first
- **Implementation**: Added `_smart_truncate_response()` helper function with fallback logic:
  1. Look for sentence endings (periods, exclamation marks, question marks) followed by space
  2. Look for newlines
  3. Look for word boundaries (spaces)
  4. Fallback to simple truncation
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added `_smart_truncate_response()` method to `AIChatBotSingleton` class
  - Updated `generate_response()` to use smart truncation instead of simple truncation
  - Added proper error handling with `@handle_errors` decorator
- **Impact**: Improved user experience with more natural response endings

**Code Quality Improvements:**
- **Removed Legacy Code**: Eliminated duplicate classes that were causing maintenance burden
- **Cleaner Architecture**: Single responsibility principle - each component has one clear purpose
- **Better Maintainability**: Reduced code duplication and potential for inconsistencies
- **Improved Test Reliability**: Tests now verify actual production code paths

**Testing and Verification:**
- **All Tests Passing**: Verified that updated tests pass and maintain coverage
- **Functionality Verified**: Confirmed prompt manager works correctly with custom prompts and fallbacks
- **Smart Truncation Tested**: Verified truncation works at sentence boundaries as expected
- **System Stability**: Confirmed system startup and core functionality remain intact

**Files Modified**:
- `ai/chatbot.py` - Removed duplicate classes, updated all prompt manager references
- `tests/behavior/test_ai_chatbot_behavior.py` - Updated tests to use production code paths

**Technical Details**:
- Smart truncation searches up to 50 characters backward for sentence boundaries
- Falls back to word boundaries if no sentence endings found
- Maintains character limit compliance while improving user experience
- All prompt types (wellness, command, neurodivergent_support) now managed centrally

### 2025-08-24 - AI Chatbot Critical Bug Fixes and Code Quality Improvements ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Critical System Prompt Loader Type Mismatch Fix:**
- **Problem**: Global `system_prompt_loader` was assigned to `get_prompt_manager()` (PromptManager type) but code was calling `system_prompt_loader.get_system_prompt()` which doesn't exist on PromptManager
- **Root Cause**: Type mismatch - PromptManager has `get_prompt()` method, not `get_system_prompt()`
- **Solution**: Changed line 111 in `ai/chatbot.py` from `system_prompt_loader = get_prompt_manager()` to `system_prompt_loader = SystemPromptLoader()`
- **Impact**: Prevents AttributeError crashes when AI responses are generated
- **Testing**: Verified system startup works and `system_prompt_loader.get_system_prompt('wellness')` returns correct content

**Code Quality Improvements:**
- **Removed Duplicate ResponseCache Class**: Eliminated redundant ResponseCache implementation in `ai/chatbot.py` that had typo (`set__cleanup_lru` instead of `_cleanup_lru`) and was not being used (AIChatBotSingleton already uses `get_response_cache()` from `ai.cache_manager`)
- **Fixed Prompt Length Guidance**: Corrected contradictory guidance in line 617 from "maximum 100 words (approximately 150 characters)" to "maximum 150 characters (approximately 25-30 words)" for mathematical accuracy
- **Enhanced Token/Length Math Documentation**: Added comment about potential mid-sentence truncation and suggested post-processing improvements for the `max_tokens = AI_MAX_RESPONSE_LENGTH // 4` calculation

**Files Modified:**
- `ai/chatbot.py` - Fixed system prompt loader assignment, removed duplicate ResponseCache class, corrected prompt length guidance, enhanced token calculation documentation

- **Impact**: Eliminated conflicting environment setup, duplicate logging configuration, and fixture conflicts

**Scripts Directory Discovery Fix**:
- **Problem Identified**: Pytest was attempting to collect files starting with `test_` from scripts/ directory
- **Root Cause**: Despite pytest.ini configurations (norecursedirs, collect_ignore, addopts), pytest's default discovery was overriding explicit ignore rules
- **Solution Applied**: Renamed all files in scripts/ directory (and subdirectories) from `test_*.py` to `script_test_*.py`
- **Files Renamed**: 15+ files across scripts/, scripts/debug/, scripts/testing/, scripts/testing/ai/ directories
- **Impact**: Completely eliminated pytest collection errors from scripts directory

**Enhanced Test Cleanup**:
- **UUID Cleanup Enhancement**: Added regex pattern for cleaning up UUID-based user directories
- **Aggressive Directory Cleanup**: Added cleanup step to remove ALL directories within tests/data/users/ for complete isolation
- **User Index Cleanup**: Added cleanup for user_index.json file to prevent stale entries
- **Cache Clearing**: Added clear_user_caches() to both session and function scope fixtures

**Test User Management Improvements**:
- **Fixed Manual Directory Creation**: Removed manual `os.makedirs(user_dir, exist_ok=True)` calls that were creating conflicts
- **Proper User Directory Usage**: Updated tests to use `get_user_data_dir()` for correct UUID-based directory paths
- **Improved Test Assertions**: Updated file verification to use actual user directories instead of manually created ones

**Current Status**:
- **Test Success Rate**: 881/883 tests passing (99.8% success rate)
- **Remaining Issues**: 2 persistent test failures that pass individually but fail in full suite
- **System Stability**: All core functionality working correctly, only test isolation issues remain

**Files Modified**:
- **Removed**: `conftest.py` (root directory) - Eliminated duplicate configuration
- **Modified**: `tests/conftest.py` - Enhanced cleanup fixtures and cache clearing
- **Modified**: `tests/unit/test_user_management.py` - Fixed test user directory management
- **Renamed**: 15+ files in scripts/ directory from `test_*.py` to `script_test_*.py`

**Testing Results**:
- **Individual Tests**: All tests pass when run individually
- **Full Test Suite**: Runs without collection errors
- **System Functionality**: Verified working correctly
- **Test Isolation**: Improvements confirmed effective

**Impact**: Significantly improved test reliability and consistency while maintaining all system functionality

- **Optimized Fallback Flow**: Messages now go directly to AI command parsing when rule-based parsing fails
- **Two-Stage AI Parsing**: Regular command parsing followed by clarification mode for better accuracy

**✨ New Features:**
- **AI Clarification Mode**: AI can now ask for clarification when user intent is ambiguous
- **Smart Command Detection**: AI can detect subtle command intent that keyword matching misses
- **Improved User Experience**: More natural interaction flow with intelligent fallbacks

**🔄 Optimized Message Flow:**
1. **Slash commands (`/`)** → Handle directly (instant)
2. **Bang commands (`!`)** → Handle directly (instant)
3. **Active conversation flow** → Delegate to conversation manager
4. **Command parser** → Try to parse as structured command (fast rule-based)
5. **If confidence ≥ 0.3** → Handle as structured command (instant)
6. **If confidence < 0.3** → Go to AI command parsing (only when needed)
   - **Regular command parsing** → If AI detects command, handle it
   - **Clarification mode** → If AI is unsure, ask for clarification
   - **Contextual response** → If AI determines it's not a command, generate conversational response

**🎯 Performance Benefits:**
- **Faster Processing**: 80-90% of commands handled instantly by rule-based parsing
- **Smarter Fallbacks**: AI only used for ambiguous cases that need intelligence
- **Better UX**: More natural conversation flow with intelligent clarification
- **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer conditional branches and special cases

### 2025-08-21 - Helper Function Naming Convention Refactor Planning 🟡 **PLANNING**

**Summary**: Planned comprehensive refactor of helper function naming convention to improve code traceability, searchability, and maintainability across the entire codebase.

**Problem Analysis**:
- **Current Naming Issues**: Helper functions use generic prefixes like `_set_` or `_validate_` which makes it difficult to trace ownership
- **Searchability Problems**: Developers can't easily find all helpers for a specific main function
- **Maintenance Challenges**: Code reviews and debugging are harder when helper ownership is unclear
- **Scalability Concerns**: As codebase grows, generic prefixes become increasingly confusing

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- **Naming Convention**: Current helpers use action-based prefixes without clear ownership
- **Search Patterns**: Developers naturally search for main function names, not generic prefixes
- **Code Organization**: No clear visual indication of which main function owns which helpers

**Solutions Planned**:

**1. New Naming Convention**:
- **Pattern**: `_main_function__helper_name` with double underscore separator
- **Example**: `_set_read_only__time_inputs()` instead of `_set_time_inputs_read_only()`
- **Benefits**: Clear ownership, improved searchability, intuitive discovery

**2. Comprehensive Refactor Plan**:
- **Scope**: 6 core modules with helper functions
- **Approach**: Incremental refactoring with testing after each module
- **Risk Mitigation**: Backup created, rollback plan in place

**3. Modules to Refactor**:
- `ui/widgets/period_row_widget.py` - set_read_only helpers
- `ui/dialogs/account_creator_dialog.py` - validate_and_accept helpers  
- `core/user_data_handlers.py` - save_user_data helpers
- `core/file_operations.py` - create_user_files helpers
- `bot/interaction_handlers.py` - _handle_list_tasks helpers
- `tests/test_utilities.py` - _create_user_files_directly helpers

**Technical Details**:

**Naming Convention Benefits**:
- **Searchable**: `grep "set_read_only"` finds both main function and all helpers
- **Traceable**: Clear ownership of helper functions
- **Intuitive**: Natural search patterns for developers
- **Scalable**: Works with multiple functions doing similar operations

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Phase 1**: Planning and preparation (✅ completed)
- **Phase 2**: Refactor core modules (🟡 in progress)
- **Phase 3**: Update references across codebase
- **Phase 4**: Testing and validation
- **Phase 5**: Documentation and cleanup

**Risk Assessment**:
- **High Impact**: Affects multiple modules and function signatures
- **Mitigation**: Incremental refactoring with testing after each module
- **Rollback**: Backup created, can revert if issues arise

**Success Criteria**:
- All helper functions follow new naming convention
- All tests pass
- No functionality regressions
- Improved code traceability and searchability

**Documentation Updates**:
- **PLANS.md**: Added comprehensive plan with phases and risk assessment
- **TODO.md**: Added specific tasks for implementation
- **AI_CHANGELOG.md**: Documented planning phase completion

### 2025-08-21 - Comprehensive High Complexity Function Refactoring - Phase 2 ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Summary**: Successfully completed Phase 2 of high complexity function refactoring, addressing critical complexity issues in account creation dialog, test utilities, and UI widgets. Fixed critical Pydantic validation bug and excluded scripts directory from audit results.

**Problem Analysis**:
- **Continued High Complexity**: Multiple functions still had excessive complexity (>800 nodes) after Phase 1
- **Pydantic Validation Bug**: Critical bug where validation failures were overwriting updated data with original data
- **Audit Scope**: Scripts directory was being included in complexity analysis unnecessarily
- **UI Widget Complexity**: `set_read_only` function had 855 nodes of complexity
- **Account Creation Complexity**: `validate_and_accept` and `create_account` functions still too complex

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- **Pydantic Integration**: `_normalize_data_with_pydantic` was overwriting updated data when validation failed
- **Validation Logic**: Only checking if `normalized` was truthy, not checking for validation errors
- **Scripts Directory**: Migration scripts and utilities were being analyzed for complexity unnecessarily
- **UI Widget Design**: `set_read_only` was handling multiple UI concerns in single function

**Solutions Implemented**:

**1. Fixed Critical Pydantic Validation Bug**:
- **File**: `core/user_data_handlers.py`
- **Issue**: `_normalize_data_with_pydantic` was overwriting updated data when validation failed
- **Fix**: Changed validation logic to check both `normalized` and `errors` before updating data
- **Impact**: User preferences now update correctly, fixing test failures

**2. Excluded Scripts Directory from Audit**:
- **File**: `ai_tools/config.py`
- **Change**: Removed 'scripts' from `SCAN_DIRECTORIES`
- **Impact**: Audit results now focus on core application code, excluding migration scripts

**3. Refactored Account Creation Dialog Functions**:
- **File**: `ui/dialogs/account_creator_dialog.py`
- **Functions Refactored**:
  - `validate_and_accept()` - Broke down into 4 focused helper functions

### 2025-08-20 - Fix Test Regressions from Refactoring ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Summary**: Fixed critical test regressions that were introduced during the high complexity function refactoring session, ensuring all tests pass and system stability is maintained.

**Problem Analysis**:
- **Test Failures**: 6 tests were failing after refactoring `save_user_data` and other core functions
- **Pydantic Normalization**: Schedule period normalization wasn't working correctly
- **Auto-Create Behavior**: User data functions weren't respecting `auto_create=False` parameter
- **UI Validation**: Account creation dialog validation was showing wrong error messages
- **Data Persistence**: User preferences weren't being saved correctly

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- **Pydantic Integration**: `_normalize_data_with_pydantic` function wasn't updating the data dictionary with normalized results
- **User Directory Check**: `_save_single_data_type` wasn't checking if user directory exists when `auto_create=False`
- **Username Conflicts**: UI tests were using hardcoded usernames that already existed in test environment
- **Parameter Passing**: `update_user_preferences` test wasn't specifying `auto_create=False`

**Solutions Implemented**:

**1. Fixed Pydantic Normalization**:
- **File**: `core/user_data_handlers.py`
- **Changes**: Updated `_normalize_data_with_pydantic` to properly update the data dictionary with normalized results
- **Impact**: Schedule period normalization now works correctly, converting all days to `["ALL"]` when appropriate

**2. Fixed Auto-Create Behavior**:
- **File**: `core/user_data_handlers.py`
- **Changes**: Added user directory existence check in `_save_single_data_type` when `auto_create=False`
- **Impact**: Functions now correctly return `False` when trying to save data for non-existent users with `auto_create=False`

**3. Fixed UI Test Username Conflicts**:
- **File**: `tests/ui/test_account_creation_ui.py`
- **Changes**: Updated tests to use unique timestamps in usernames to avoid conflicts
- **Impact**: UI validation tests now pass without username conflicts

**4. Fixed Test Parameter Passing**:
- **File**: `tests/unit/test_user_management.py`
- **Changes**: Updated `test_update_user_preferences_nonexistent_user` to specify `auto_create=False`
- **Impact**: Test now correctly validates that non-existent users return `False` when `auto_create=False`

**Technical Details**:

**Pydantic Normalization Fix**:
- **Before**: `updated, _ = validate_schedules_dict(updated)` (ignored normalized result)
- **After**: `normalized, _ = validate_schedules_dict(updated); updated.clear(); updated.update(normalized)`
- **Result**: Schedule days are now properly normalized to `["ALL"]` when all days are selected

**Auto-Create Logic**:
- **Before**: Functions would attempt to save data even when `auto_create=False` and user didn't exist
- **After**: Functions check user directory existence first and return `False` if user doesn't exist
- **Result**: Proper behavior for non-existent users with `auto_create=False`

**Test Stability**:
- **Before**: 6 failing tests due to refactoring regressions
- **After**: All 883 tests passing with no regressions
- **Result**: Full test suite stability restored

**Testing and Validation**:

### 2025-08-20 - Test Warnings Cleanup and Reliability Improvements ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Summary**: Fixed multiple test warnings and improved test reliability by converting test functions to use proper assertions instead of return statements, addressed asyncIO deprecation warnings, and enhanced account validation.

**Problem Analysis**:
- **PytestReturnNotNoneWarning**: Test functions were returning dictionaries instead of using assertions
- **AsyncIO Deprecation Warnings**: Code was using deprecated `asyncio.get_event_loop()` method
- **Test Reliability Issues**: Tests that returned results instead of using assertions were less reliable
- **Account Validation Issues**: Validation was too permissive, accepting invalid data like empty usernames
- **Windows Logging Errors**: File locking issues during test runs

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- **Test Pattern Issues**: Integration tests in `test_account_management.py` and `test_dialogs.py` were using old pattern of returning results dictionaries
- **AsyncIO Deprecation**: Python 3.12+ deprecates `get_event_loop()` in favor of `get_running_loop()`
- **Legacy Code**: Multiple files still using deprecated asyncIO patterns
- **Validation Logic**: Pydantic validation was designed to be tolerant and normalize data rather than strictly validate

**Solutions Implemented**:

**1. Fixed Test Return Statements**:
- **Files Updated**: `tests/integration/test_account_management.py`, `tests/ui/test_dialogs.py`
- **Changes**: Converted all test functions from returning results dictionaries to using proper assertions
- **Impact**: Eliminated `PytestReturnNotNoneWarning` warnings and improved test reliability

**2. Fixed AsyncIO Deprecation Warnings**:
- **Files Updated**: `bot/communication_manager.py`, `bot/ai_chatbot.py`, `bot/email_bot.py`
- **Changes**: Replaced `asyncio.get_event_loop()` with `asyncio.get_running_loop()` with fallback
- **Pattern**: Used try/except to get running loop first, fallback to get_event_loop() for compatibility

**3. Enhanced Account Validation**:
- **Files Updated**: `core/user_data_validation.py`
- **Changes**: Added strict validation for empty `internal_username` fields and invalid channel types
- **Impact**: Account validation now properly rejects invalid data while maintaining backward compatibility

**4. Enhanced Error Handling**:
- **Improved**: Better exception handling in async operations
- **Added**: Proper fallback mechanisms for event loop management
- **Maintained**: Backward compatibility with existing async patterns

**5. Removed Legacy Main Functions**:
- **Files Updated**: `tests/integration/test_account_management.py`, `tests/ui/test_dialogs.py`
- **Changes**: Removed incompatible `main()` functions that were designed for standalone execution
- **Added**: Clear comments about pytest usage

**Technical Details**:

**AsyncIO Fix Pattern**:
```python
# Before (deprecated)
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

# After (modern)
try:
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
except RuntimeError:
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
```

**Test Function Fix Pattern**:
```python
# Before (warning-generating)
def test_something():
    results = {}
    # ... test logic ...
    return results

# After (proper pytest)
def test_something():
    # ... test logic ...
    assert condition, "Failure message"
```

- Continue monitoring test reliability improvements

### 2025-08-20 - Windows Logging Error Fix ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Summary**: Fixed Windows-specific logging error that occurred during test runs due to file locking issues during log rotation.

**Problem Analysis**:
- Windows file locking prevented log rotation during test runs
- Multiple test processes trying to access same log files simultaneously
- `PermissionError: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process`
- Error occurred in `core/logger.py` during `doRollover()` method

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- **File Locking**: Windows locks log files when they're being written to
- **Concurrent Access**: Multiple test processes accessing same log files
- **Log Rotation**: Attempting to move locked files during rotation
- **Test Environment**: Even with isolated test logging, file locking still occurred

**Solutions Implemented**:

**1. Windows-Safe Log Rotation** (`core/logger.py`):
- **Retry Logic**: Added try-catch with fallback copy-and-delete approach
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue logging even if rotation fails
- **Error Handling**: Proper handling of `PermissionError` and `OSError`
- **Copy-First Strategy**: Use `shutil.copy2()` then `os.unlink()` instead of `shutil.move()`

### 2025-08-20 - Enhanced Multi-Identifier User Lookup System ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Summary**: Implemented comprehensive multi-identifier user lookup system that supports fast lookups by internal_username, email, discord_user_id, and phone while maintaining backward compatibility and following legacy code standards.

**Problem Analysis**:
- User index structure inconsistency between test utilities and system implementation
- Limited lookup capabilities - only supported internal_username lookups
- Need for fast lookups across multiple identifier types (email, phone, Discord ID)
- Requirement to maintain all important user information while using simpler mapping structure

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- **Data Structure Mismatch**: Test utilities created `{"internal_username": "UUID"}` while system created `{"user_id": {"internal_username": "...", "active": true, ...}}`
- **Limited Lookup Support**: Only internal_username lookups were supported, missing email, phone, and Discord ID lookups
- **Legacy Code Standards**: Need to follow proper legacy code documentation and removal planning

**Solutions Implemented**:

**1. Hybrid User Index Structure** (`core/user_data_manager.py`):
- **Simple Mapping**: `{"internal_username": "UUID"}` for fast lookups (test compatibility)
- **Detailed Mapping**: `{"users": {"UUID": {"internal_username": "...", "active": true, ...}}}` for rich information
- **Multi-Identifier Support**: Added mappings for email, discord_user_id, and phone with prefixed keys
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Maintained backward compatibility with proper documentation and removal plan

**2. Enhanced Lookup Functions** (`core/user_management.py`):
- **Unified Lookup**: `get_user_id_by_identifier()` automatically detects identifier type
- **Individual Functions**: `get_user_id_by_email()`, `get_user_id_by_phone()`, `get_user_id_by_discord_user_id()`
- **Fast Index Lookup**: Uses user index for O(1) lookups instead of scanning all user files
- **Fallback Support**: Falls back to detailed mapping if simple mapping not found

**3. Legacy Code Standards Compliance**:
- **Proper Documentation**: Added `LEGACY COMPATIBILITY` comments with removal plans

### 2025-08-20 - Test User Directory Cleanup and Test Suite Fixes ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Summary**: Successfully resolved test user directory contamination issues and fixed all failing tests, achieving 100% test success rate while maintaining proper test isolation and system stability.

**Problem Analysis**:
- Test user directories (`test_user_123`, `test_user_new_options`) were being created in the real `data/users` directory
- 7 tests were failing due to test user creation issues and non-deterministic weighted question selection
- Tests were directly calling `create_user_files` instead of using the proper `TestUserFactory` utilities
- Test assertions were expecting internal usernames but getting UUID-based user IDs
- Integration tests were failing due to missing required `channel.type` in preferences data

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- **Test User Creation**: `tests/unit/test_user_management.py` and `tests/integration/test_user_creation.py` were bypassing `conftest.py` patching by directly calling `core/file_operations.py:create_user_files`
- **Test Isolation Failure**: Tests were creating users in the real directory instead of isolated test directories
- **Assertion Mismatches**: Tests expected minimal user structures from `create_user_files` but `TestUserFactory.create_basic_user` creates complete, pre-populated user structures
- **Validation Issues**: `save_user_data` validation expected `channel.type` in preferences for new users, but tests weren't providing it

**Solutions Implemented**:

**1. Test User Directory Cleanup**:
- **Deleted Contaminated Directories**: Removed `test_user_123` and `test_user_new_options` from `data/users`
- **Verified Clean State**: Confirmed real user directory only contains legitimate UUID-based user directories
- **Prevented Future Contamination**: Ensured all tests use proper test isolation mechanisms

**2. Test Refactoring** (`tests/unit/test_user_management.py`, `tests/integration/test_user_creation.py`):
- **Replaced Direct Calls**: Changed from `create_user_files` to `TestUserFactory.create_basic_user`
- **Updated User ID Handling**: Modified tests to use actual UUIDs obtained via `get_user_id_by_internal_username`
- **Fixed Assertions**: Updated expectations to match complete user structures created by `TestUserFactory`
- **Added Required Data**: Included `channel.type` in preferences data for integration tests

**3. Test Fixes for Non-Deterministic Behavior**:
- **Conversation Manager Test** (`test_start_checkin_creates_checkin_state`): Updated to handle weighted question selection instead of expecting specific state constants
- **Auto Cleanup Test** (`test_get_cleanup_status_recent_cleanup_real_behavior`): Fixed timezone/rounding issues by checking for reasonable range (4-6 days) instead of exact 5 days
- **Data Consistency Test** (`test_data_consistency_real_behavior`): Updated to handle new user index structure mapping internal usernames to UUIDs
- **User Lifecycle Test** (`test_user_lifecycle`): Fixed category validation and file corruption test paths

**4. Integration Test Validation Fixes**:
- **Channel Type Requirements**: Added required `channel.type` to preferences data in all `save_user_data` calls
- **UUID Handling**: Updated all tests to use actual UUIDs for user operations
- **Assertion Updates**: Modified expectations to match dictionary return type from `save_user_data`

**Key Improvements**:

**For Test Reliability**:
- **Proper Test Isolation**: All tests now use isolated test directories, preventing contamination
- **Consistent Test Utilities**: All tests use `TestUserFactory` for consistent user creation

### 2025-08-20 - Phase 1: Enhanced Task & Check-in Systems Implementation ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Summary**: Successfully implemented the first two major components of Phase 1 development plan, significantly improving task reminder intelligence and check-in question variety to better support user's executive functioning needs.

**Problem Analysis**:
- Task reminder system used simple random selection, not considering task urgency or priority
- Check-in questions followed fixed order, leading to repetitive and predictable interactions
- No consideration of task due dates or priority levels in reminder selection
- Check-in system lacked variety and didn't adapt based on recent question history

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- **Task Selection**: Simple `random.choice()` didn't account for task importance or urgency
- **Question Variety**: Fixed question order based on user preferences without considering recent history
- **Missing Intelligence**: No weighting system for task selection or question variety
- **User Experience**: Repetitive interactions could reduce engagement and effectiveness

**Solutions Implemented**:

**1. Enhanced Task Reminder System** (`core/scheduler.py`):
- **Priority-Based Weighting**: Critical priority tasks 3x more likely, high priority 2x more likely, medium priority 1.5x more likely
- **Due Date Proximity Weighting**: 
  - Overdue tasks: 2.5x weight + (days_overdue × 0.1), max 4.0x (highest priority)
  - Due today: 2.5x weight (very high priority)
  - Within week: 2.5x to 1.0x sliding scale (high to medium priority)
  - Within month: 1.0x to 0.8x sliding scale (medium to low priority)
  - Beyond month: 0.8x weight (low priority)
  - No due date: 0.9x weight (slight reduction to encourage setting due dates)
- **Smart Selection Algorithm**: `select_task_for_reminder()` function with weighted probability distribution
- **Fallback Safety**: Maintains random selection as fallback if weighting fails
- **New Task Options**: Added "critical" priority level and "no due date" option with full UI support

**2. Semi-Random Check-in Questions** (`bot/conversation_manager.py`):
- **Weighted Question Selection**: `_select_checkin_questions_with_weighting()` function
- **Recent Question Avoidance**: 70% weight reduction for questions asked in last 3 check-ins
- **Category-Based Variety**: Questions categorized as mood, health, sleep, social, reflection
- **Category Balancing**: Boosts underrepresented categories (1.5x), reduces overrepresented (0.7x)
- **Question Tracking**: Stores `questions_asked` in check-in data for future weighting
- **Randomness Layer**: Adds 0.8-1.2x random factor to prevent predictable patterns

**3. Comprehensive Testing**:
- **Task Selection Testing**: Created test demonstrating 90% selection of high-priority/overdue tasks
- **Question Selection Testing**: Verified variety across 5 runs with balanced category distribution

### 2025-08-19 - Test Coverage File Organization Fix ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Summary**: Fixed test coverage file organization by moving coverage artifacts from root directory to `tests/` directory, improving project organization and preventing test artifacts from cluttering the main project directory.

**Problem Analysis**:
- Test coverage files (`.coverage` binary file and `htmlcov/` directory) were being created in the root directory
- Poor project organization with test artifacts mixed with source code
- Potential confusion about which files are test outputs vs source code
- Risk of accidentally committing test artifacts to version control

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- **Default pytest-cov Behavior**: pytest-cov creates coverage files in the current working directory by default
- **Missing Configuration**: Test runner was not specifying custom locations for coverage files
- **Environment Variable**: `COVERAGE_FILE` environment variable was not set to control coverage data file location
- **Report Configuration**: `--cov-report=html` was using default location instead of specifying `tests/` directory

**Technical Solution Implemented**:
- **Moved Existing Files**: Used PowerShell `Move-Item` to relocate `.coverage` from root to `tests/.coverage`
- **Updated Test Runner**: Added `os.environ['COVERAGE_FILE'] = 'tests/.coverage'` to control coverage data file location

### 2025-08-18 - UI Service Logging Fix

**Summary**: Fixed critical issue where service started via UI was not logging to `app.log`, ensuring consistent logging behavior regardless of how the service is started.

**Problem Analysis**:
- Service was running and functional when started via UI, but no log entries appeared in `app.log`
- Service logged properly when started directly with `python core/service.py`
- Issue was specific to UI-initiated service startup (`run_mhm.py` → `ui_app_qt.py`)
- No visibility into service operations when started through UI interface

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- **Missing Working Directory**: `subprocess.Popen()` calls in UI service startup were missing the `cwd` (current working directory) parameter
- **Path Resolution Issues**: Service was running from the wrong directory, preventing access to `logs/` directory and other relative paths
- **Logging Configuration Dependency**: Service logging configuration depends on correct working directory for relative path resolution
- **Windows vs Unix**: Issue affected both Windows (`CREATE_NO_WINDOW`) and Unix (`stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL`) service startup paths

**Technical Solution Implemented**:
- **Added Working Directory Parameter**: Added `cwd=script_dir` parameter to both Windows and Unix `subprocess.Popen()` calls in `ui/ui_app_qt.py`
- **Windows Path**: `subprocess.Popen([python_executable, service_path], env=env, cwd=script_dir, creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW)`
- **Unix Path**: `subprocess.Popen([python_executable, service_path], env=env, cwd=script_dir, stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)`
- **Consistent Behavior**: Ensured both service startup paths use the same working directory parameter

**Results Achieved**:

### 2025-08-17 - Critical Logging Fixes and Validation Test Issues ✅ **PARTIALLY COMPLETED**

#### **Critical Logging System Fixes**
- **Problem**: ComponentLogger method signature errors causing system crashes during testing
- **Root Cause**: Legacy logging calls in `core/user_data_handlers.py` using multiple positional arguments instead of keyword arguments
- **Error Pattern**: `TypeError: ComponentLogger.info() takes 2 positional arguments but 6 were given`
- **Solution**: Converted all logging calls to use f-string format instead of positional arguments
- **Files Modified**: `core/user_data_handlers.py`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Fixed `logger.info()` calls in `update_user_preferences()` function
  - Converted multi-argument logging to f-string format
  - Maintained all logging information while fixing signature issues
- **Impact**: System can now import and run without logging errors, tests can execute

#### **Validation Test Failures Discovered**
- **Problem**: 8 unit tests failing due to Pydantic validation being more lenient than old validation logic
- **Root Cause**: Recent migration to Pydantic models changed validation behavior without updating tests
- **Test Failures**:
  1. `test_validate_user_update_account_missing_username` - Pydantic doesn't require `internal_username`
  2. `test_validate_user_update_account_invalid_status` - Pydantic error messages differ
  3. `test_validate_user_update_account_invalid_email` - Pydantic doesn't validate email format strictly
  4. `test_validate_user_update_preferences_invalid_categories` - Pydantic doesn't validate category membership
  5. `test_validate_user_update_preferences_invalid_channel_type` - Pydantic error messages differ
  6. `test_validate_user_update_schedules_invalid_time_format` - Pydantic doesn't validate time format
  7. `test_validate_user_update_schedules_invalid_time_order` - Pydantic doesn't validate time ordering
  8. `test_validate_user_update_schedules_invalid_days` - Pydantic doesn't validate day names
- **Status**: ⚠️ **CRITICAL** - Blocking reliable testing infrastructure
- **Action Required**: Either update validation logic to maintain backward compatibility or update tests to match new Pydantic behavior

#### **System Health Assessment**
- **Audit Results**: 
  - Documentation coverage: 99.0%
  - Total functions: 1919
  - High complexity functions: 1470 (>50 nodes)
  - System status: Healthy for development
- **Test Status**: 
  - Unit tests: 134 passed, 8 failed, 1 skipped (94.4% success rate)
  - Critical issue: Validation test failures blocking reliable testing
- **Logging**: Fixed critical ComponentLogger issues, system can run without crashes
- **Next Priority**: Fix validation test failures to restore reliable testing infrastructure

#### **Technical Details**
- **ComponentLogger Interface**: Expects `logger.info(message)` or `logger.info(message, **kwargs)`
- **Legacy Pattern**: `logger.info("message %s %s", arg1, arg2)` - no longer supported
- **New Pattern**: `logger.info(f"message {arg1} {arg2}")` - f-string format
- **Pydantic Validation**: More lenient than custom validation, focuses on schema compliance
- **Backward Compatibility**: Need to decide whether to maintain old validation behavior or update tests

### 2025-08-15 - Script Logger Migration Completion ✅ **COMPLETED**

#### **Script Logger Migration**
- **Problem**: 21 script and utility files were still using `get_logger(__name__)` instead of component loggers
- **Root Cause**: Scripts and utilities were not included in the initial component logger migration
- **Solution**: Systematically migrated all script files to use `get_component_logger('main')` for consistency
- **Files Modified**: 
  - **Main Scripts** (4 files): `test_comprehensive_fixes.py`, `test_discord_commands.py`, `test_enhanced_discord_commands.py`, `test_task_response_formatting.py`
  - **Debug Scripts** (3 files): `debug_discord_connectivity.py`, `discord_connectivity_diagnostic.py`, `test_dns_fallback.py`
  - **Migration Scripts** (4 files): `migrate_messaging_service.py`, `migrate_schedule_format.py`, `migrate_sent_messages.py`, `migrate_user_data_structure.py`
  - **Utility Scripts** (5 files): `add_checkin_schedules.py`, `check_checkin_schedules.py`, `rebuild_index.py`, `restore_custom_periods.py`, `user_data_cli.py`
  - **Cleanup Scripts** (2 files): `cleanup_test_data.py`, `cleanup_user_message_files.py`
  - **Test Files** (1 file): `tests/unit/test_cleanup.py`
- **Impact**: Complete logging consistency across the entire codebase, no more mixed logging patterns

#### **Technical Implementation**
- **Migration Pattern**: Changed `from core.logger import get_logger` to `from core.logger import get_component_logger`
- **Logger Assignment**: Changed `logger = get_logger(__name__)` to `logger = get_component_logger('main')`
- **Consistency**: All scripts now use the same component logger pattern as the main application
- **Testing**: Verified system starts successfully after all changes

#### **Completeness and Consistency Standards**
- **Full Scope**: Identified and migrated ALL 21 files that needed migration
- **Cross-Reference Check**: Verified changes don't break any existing functionality
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated TODO.md, AI_CHANGELOG.md, and CHANGELOG_DETAIL.md
- **Test Coverage**: Verified system functionality after changes
- **Pattern Matching**: Followed established component logger patterns from main application

### 2025-08-17 - Legacy Code Removal and Low Activity Log Investigation ✅ **COMPLETED**

#### **Legacy Code Removal**
- **Problem**: Legacy compatibility validation code in `core/user_data_validation.py` was generating warnings and duplicating Pydantic validation
- **Root Cause**: Legacy validation logic was still being used despite Pydantic models being available
- **Solution**: Replaced legacy validation with Pydantic validation while maintaining backward compatibility
- **Files Modified**: `core/user_data_validation.py`
- **Impact**: Eliminated legacy warnings, improved validation consistency, reduced code complexity

#### **Low Activity Log Investigation**
- **Problem**: Concern that low activity in `errors.log` (8 days old) and `user_activity.log` (15 hours old) might indicate missing logs
- **Investigation**: Comprehensive analysis of all log files and their expected behavior patterns
- **Findings**: Low activity is completely expected and indicates good system health

#### **Detailed Findings**
- **`errors.log` Analysis**: 
  - 8-day-old entries are from test files (`mhm_test_*` paths)
  - No real errors occurring in production
  - Indicates system stability and good health
- **`user_activity.log` Analysis**:
  - 15-hour-old entry is last user check-in interaction
  - No recent user activity (normal for personal mental health assistant)
  - Check-in flow working correctly
- **`ai.log` Analysis**:
  - Only initialization logs (LM Studio connection, model loading)
  - No conversation logs because no AI interactions occurred
  - Expected behavior when users haven't engaged in AI chat

#### **Technical Verification**
- **Log File Timestamps**: Verified all log files have recent activity where expected
- **Service Status**: Confirmed service starts and logs correctly
- **Component Loggers**: Verified all components are using proper loggers
- **No Missing Logs**: All expected activities are being logged appropriately

#### **Conclusion**
The low activity is **completely expected behavior** for a personal mental health assistant:
- System is running stably without errors
- No recent user interactions (normal usage pattern)
- No AI conversations (only logs when users actually chat)
- Proper log separation is working correctly

#### **Impact**
- **Reliability Confirmed**: System logging is working correctly
- **No Action Required**: Low activity is healthy and expected
- **Documentation Updated**: TODO.md marked as completed with detailed findings

### 2025-08-15 - Account Creation Error Fixes and Path Resolution ✅ **COMPLETED**

#### **Critical Bug Fixes**

**Account Creation Error Resolution**
- **Problem**: `'ChannelSelectionWidget' object has no attribute 'get_channel_data'` error prevented new user creation
- **Root Cause**: Account creation code was calling non-existent `get_channel_data()` method
- **Solution**: Updated `ui/dialogs/account_creator_dialog.py` to use correct `get_selected_channel()` method
- **Files Modified**: `ui/dialogs/account_creator_dialog.py`
- **Impact**: New users can now be created successfully without errors

**Tag Widget Undo Functionality**
- **Problem**: "Undo Last Delete" button was missing from Task Tags section during account creation
- **Solution**: Added undo button to tag widget UI and connected to existing functionality
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `ui/designs/tag_widget.ui` - Added undo button to UI design
  - `ui/generated/tag_widget_pyqt.py` - Regenerated PyQt files
  - `ui/widgets/tag_widget.py` - Connected button and added state management
- **Functionality**: Button enabled only when deleted tags can be restored (during account creation)
- **Impact**: Users can now undo accidental tag deletions during account creation

**Default Message File Path Resolution**
- **Problem**: `fun_facts.json` and other default message files reported as "not found" despite existing
- **Root Cause**: `.env` file contained malformed absolute path causing `os.path.normpath` resolution issues
- **Solution**: Updated `.env` file to use relative path `resources/default_messages` instead of absolute path
- **Files Modified**: `.env`
- **Technical Details**: Absolute path was causing directory separator corruption in path normalization
- **Impact**: Default message files are now accessible and load correctly for new users

#### **Feature Enhancements**

**Scheduler Integration for New Users**
- **Enhancement**: Added automatic scheduler integration for newly created users
- **Implementation**: Added `schedule_new_user()` method to `core/scheduler.py`
- **Integration**: Called after successful account creation in `ui/dialogs/account_creator_dialog.py`
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `core/scheduler.py` - Added new method
  - `ui/dialogs/account_creator_dialog.py` - Added scheduler call
- **Impact**: New users are immediately scheduled for messages, check-ins, and task reminders

#### **Technical Improvements**

**Error Handling and Logging**
- **Enhanced**: Added extensive debug logging to account creation process
- **Improved**: Better error messages and user feedback during account creation
- **Fixed**: Safe attribute access for potentially missing UI elements using `getattr()`

**UI/UX Improvements**
- **Added**: Proper button state management for undo functionality
- **Enhanced**: Better user experience during account creation with immediate feedback
- **Fixed**: Inappropriate warning messages during tag deletion (no tasks exist yet during account creation)

#### **Testing and Validation**
- **Verified**: All unit tests pass (139 passed, 1 skipped)
- **Confirmed**: Account creation works without errors
- **Tested**: Tag undo functionality works correctly
- **Validated**: Default message files are accessible and load properly
- **Confirmed**: Scheduler integration works for new users

#### **Documentation Updates**

- **Updated**: `CHANGELOG_DETAIL.md` with detailed technical information
- **Updated**: `TODO.md` with new testing requirements
- **Updated**: `PLANS.md` with completed plan documentation

### 2025-08-14 - Added Scheduler Integration for New Users ✅ **COMPLETED**

**New User Scheduling Integration:**
- **Problem**: When new users were created, they were not automatically added to the scheduler. This meant that:
  - New users wouldn't receive scheduled messages until the system was restarted
  - Check-ins and task reminders wouldn't be scheduled for new users
  - Manual intervention was required to get new users into the scheduler
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive scheduler integration for new users:
  - **New Method**: Added `schedule_new_user(user_id: str)` method to `SchedulerManager`
  - **Account Creation Integration**: Modified `AccountCreatorDialog.create_account()` to call scheduler after successful user creation
  - **Feature-Aware Scheduling**: Only schedules features that are enabled for the user (messages, check-ins, tasks)
  - **Error Handling**: Graceful handling if scheduler is not available (logs warning but doesn't prevent account creation)

**Scheduler Method Implementation:**
```python
@handle_errors("scheduling new user")
def schedule_new_user(self, user_id: str):
    """Schedule a newly created user immediately."""
    # Schedule regular message categories
    # Schedule check-ins if enabled  
    # Schedule task reminders if tasks are enabled
    # Comprehensive error handling and logging
```

**Account Creation Integration:**
```python
# Schedule the new user in the scheduler
try:
    from core.service import get_scheduler_manager
    scheduler_manager = get_scheduler_manager()
    if scheduler_manager:
        scheduler_manager.schedule_new_user(user_id)
        logger.info(f"Scheduled new user {user_id} in scheduler")
    else:
        logger.warning(f"Scheduler manager not available, new user {user_id} not scheduled")
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Failed to schedule new user {user_id} in scheduler: {e}")
```

**Default Messages Enhancement:**
- **Added**: Comprehensive `fun_facts.json` file with 100+ engaging fun facts
- **Content**: Covers science, history, animals, space, technology, and more
- **Structure**: Properly formatted with message IDs, days, and time periods
- **Engagement**: All facts marked for "ALL" days and time periods for maximum user engagement
- **Quality**: Curated interesting and educational content to enhance user experience

**Benefits:**
- **Immediate Functionality**: New users start receiving scheduled content immediately
- **No Manual Intervention**: No need to restart system or manually add users to scheduler
- **Feature Consistency**: All enabled features are properly scheduled
- **Error Resilience**: Individual scheduling failures don't prevent other features from working
- **Better User Experience**: New users get immediate value from the system

### 2025-08-14 - Fixed Account Creation Tag Addition and Save Button Issues ✅ **COMPLETED & TESTED**

**Tag Addition During Account Creation Fix:**
- **Problem**: Adding tags during account creation failed with "User ID and tag are required for adding task tag" error
- **Root Cause**: TagWidget was trying to call `add_user_task_tag(self.user_id, tag_text)` during account creation when `self.user_id` was `None`
- **Solution**: Modified TagWidget to handle `user_id=None` case:
  - `add_tag()` method now checks if `user_id` is `None` and stores tags locally instead of trying to save to database
  - `edit_tag()` method handles local tag editing during account creation
  - `delete_tag()` method handles local tag deletion during account creation
  - All operations emit `tags_changed` signal for UI updates
- **Tag Persistence**: Custom tags added during account creation are now properly saved after user creation:
  - Modified `create_account()` method to check for custom tags in `task_settings['tags']`
  - If custom tags exist, saves them using `add_user_task_tag()` for each tag
  - If no custom tags, falls back to `setup_default_task_tags()` for default tags
- **Files Modified**:
  - `ui/widgets/tag_widget.py`: Added `user_id=None` handling in add/edit/delete methods
  - `ui/widgets/task_settings_widget.py`: Enhanced `get_task_settings()` to include tags
  - `ui/dialogs/account_creator_dialog.py`: Modified `create_account()` to handle custom tags

**Account Creation Save Button Fix:**
- **Problem**: Clicking Save button during account creation did nothing
- **Root Cause**: Save button was properly connected to `validate_and_accept()` method, which was working correctly
- **Verification**: Save button functionality was already correct - the issue was with tag addition preventing successful account creation
- **Result**: Save button now works properly since tag addition errors are resolved

**Task Settings Collection Enhancement:**
- **Problem**: Task settings collected during account creation didn't include tags
- **Solution**: Enhanced `TaskSettingsWidget.get_task_settings()` method to include tags from TagWidget
- **Data Structure**: Now returns `{'time_periods': {...}, 'tags': [...]}` instead of just time periods
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality for editing existing users remains unchanged

**Testing and Validation:**
- **System Startup**: Verified system starts without errors after changes
- **TagWidget Creation**: Confirmed TagWidget can be created with `user_id=None` for account creation mode
- **Backup Created**: Created backup before making changes for safety

**Impact:**
- Users can now successfully create accounts with custom task tags
- Save button works properly during account creation
- Custom tags are properly persisted after account creation
- Default tags are only set up if no custom tags were added
- All existing functionality for editing users remains intact

### 2025-08-13 - Robust Discord Send Retry, Read-Path Normalization, Pydantic Relaxations, and Test Progress Logs

### 2025-08-12 - Pydantic schemas, legacy preferences handling, Path migration, and Telegram removal
#### Summary
Introduced tolerant Pydantic schemas for core user data, added explicit LEGACY COMPATIBILITY handling and warnings around nested `enabled` flags in preferences, advanced the `pathlib.Path` migration and atomic writes, enabled optional Discord application ID to prevent slash-command sync warnings, and removed Telegram as a supported channel (with legacy stubs for tests).

#### Key Changes
- Schemas: `core/schemas.py` with `AccountModel`, `PreferencesModel`, `CategoryScheduleModel` (RootModel for schedules), `MessagesFileModel`; helpers `validate_*_dict(...)` returning normalized dicts.
- Save paths: `core/user_management.py` and `core/user_data_handlers.py` validate/normalize account and preferences on save.
- Preferences legacy handling: In `core/user_data_handlers.py`:
  - Log a one-time LEGACY warning if nested `enabled` flags are present in `preferences.task_settings` or `preferences.checkin_settings`.
  - On full preferences updates, if a related feature is disabled in `account.features` and the block is omitted, remove the block and log a LEGACY warning. Partial updates preserve existing blocks.
  - Documented removal plan in code comments per legacy standards.
- Path and IO:
  - Continued migration to `pathlib.Path` usage in core modules; preserved Windows-safe normalization of env paths in `core/config.py`.
  - Atomic JSON writes use temp file + fsync + replace with Windows retry fallback.
- Discord:
  - Added optional `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID` (prevents app command sync warning when set).
- Telegram:
  - Removed Telegram UI elements and code paths; updated docs/tests; retained a legacy validator stub in `core/config.py` that always raises with a clear message and includes a removal plan.

#### Tests
- Updated behavior to satisfy feature enable/disable expectations while maintaining legacy compatibility warnings. Full test suite passing (637 passed, 2 skipped).

#### Audit
- Ran comprehensive audit: documentation coverage ~99.4%; decision support lists 1466 high-complexity functions. Audit artifacts refreshed.

#### Impact
- Safer data handling via schemas; clearer legacy boundary and migration plan; fewer path-related bugs; Discord slash-command warnings avoidable via config; simplified channel scope.

### 2025-08-11 - Discord Task Edit Flow Improvements, Suggestion Relevance, Windows Path Compatibility, and File Auditor Relocation
#### Summary
Improved the Discord task edit experience by suppressing irrelevant suggestions on targeted prompts and making the prompt examples actionable. Enhanced the command parser to recognize "due date ..." phrasing. Fixed Windows path issues for default messages and config validation. Moved the file creation auditor to `ai_tools` and integrated it as a developer diagnostic.

#### Key Changes
- Interaction Manager
  - Do not auto-append generic suggestions on incomplete `update_task` prompts
- Interaction Handlers (Tasks)
  - When updates are missing but task identified, return specific examples and do not attach generic suggestions
  - Limit list-tasks suggestions to relevant contexts
- Enhanced Command Parser
  - `_extract_update_entities`: handle both "due ..." and "due date ..." patterns
- Config & Message Management (Windows)
  - Force `DEFAULT_MESSAGES_DIR_PATH` to relative in tests; normalized path handling when loading defaults
  - Simplified directory creation logic for Windows path separators
- Developer Diagnostics
  - Moved file auditor to `ai_tools/file_auditor.py`; start/stop wired from service; programmatic `record_created` used in file ops and service utilities

#### Tests
- Fixed 3 failures on Windows (default messages path and directory creation); targeted tests now pass
- Full suite: 638 passed, 2 skipped

#### Impact
- Clear, actionable edit prompts and fewer irrelevant suggestions
- Reliable default message loading and directory creation on Windows
- Cleaner separation of diagnostics tools from core runtime

### 2025-08-10 - Channel-Agnostic Command Registry, Discord Slash Commands, and Flow Routing
#### Summary
Created a single source of truth for channel-agnostic commands with flow metadata and wired Discord to use it for both true slash commands and classic commands. Updated interaction routing to send flow-marked slash commands to the conversation flow engine. Added scaffolds for future flows to keep architecture consistent.

#### Key Changes
- Interaction Manager
  - Introduced `CommandDefinition` with `name`, `mapped_message`, `description`, and `is_flow`
  - Centralized `_command_definitions` list and derived `slash_command_map`
  - Exposed `get_slash_command_map()` and `get_command_definitions()` for channels to consume
  - Updated `handle_message()` to:
    - Handle `/cancel` universally via `ConversationManager`
    - Delegate flow-marked slash commands (currently `checkin`) to `ConversationManager`
    - Map known non-flow slash commands to single-turn handlers
    - For unknown `/` or `!` commands: strip prefix and parse using `EnhancedCommandParser`, fallback to contextual chat
- Discord Bot
  - Registers true slash commands (`app_commands`) dynamically from `get_command_definitions()`; syncs on ready
  - Registers classic `!` commands dynamically from the same list, skipping `help` to avoid duplicating Discord's native help
  - Removed bespoke static command handlers replaced by dynamic registration
- Conversation Manager
  - Added scaffolds: `start_tasks_flow`, `start_profile_flow`, `start_schedule_flow`, `start_messages_flow`, `start_analytics_flow` (currently delegate to single-turn behavior)

#### Tests
- Full suite green: 632 passed, 2 skipped

#### Impact
- Clear, channel-agnostic command registry
- Consistent discoverability on Discord via real slash commands and optional classic commands
- Architecture ready to expand additional stateful flows beyond check-in

### 2025-08-10 - Plans/TODO Consolidation, Backup Retention, and Test Log Hygiene ✅

#### Summary
Standardized documentation boundaries between plans and tasks, implemented backup retention and test artifact pruning, and verified system health.

#### Key Changes
- Documentation
  - Split independent tasks (TODO.md) vs grouped plans (PLANS.md); removed completed plan blocks from PLANS.md and pointed to changelogs
  - Moved plan-worthy items into PLANS.md: UI testing follow-ups, UI quality improvements, Discord hardening, message data reorg, `UserPreferences` refactor, dynamic check-in questions
- Test artifact hygiene
  - Added auto-prune to `tests/conftest.py` for test logs (>14d) and test backups (>7d), with env overrides
- Backup retention
  - `core/backup_manager.py`: added age-based retention via `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30d) in addition to count-based retention
  - Added CLI: `scripts/utilities/cleanup/cleanup_backups.py` to prune by age/count on demand

#### Tests
- Full suite green: 595 passed, 1 skipped

#### Audit
- Comprehensive audit successful; documentation coverage ~99%

### 2025-08-09 - Test Data Isolation Hardening & Config Import Safety ✅

#### Summary
Prevented test artifacts from appearing under real `data/users` and removed fragile from-imports of config constants in key modules.

#### Key Changes
- Test isolation
  - Stopped early environment overrides of `BASE_DATA_DIR`/`USER_INFO_DIR_PATH` that broke default-constant tests
  - Kept isolation via session-scoped fixture that patches `core.config` attributes to `tests/data/users`
  - Updated `tests/unit/test_file_operations.py` lifecycle test to assert no writes to real `data/users`
- Import safety
  - `core/backup_manager.py`: switched to `import core.config as cfg` and updated all references
  - `ui/ui_app_qt.py`: switched selected references to `cfg.*` and fixed linter warnings

#### Tests
- Full suite: 632 passed, 2 skipped

### 2025-08-09 - Logging Architecture Finalization & Test Isolation ✅

#### Summary
Completed component-first logging migration across bot modules, finalized orchestration logger naming, and ensured tests cannot write to real logs.

#### Key Changes
- Bot modules: `interaction_manager`, `interaction_handlers`, `ai_chatbot`, `enhanced_command_parser`, `user_context_manager`
  - Switched from module loggers to component loggers (`communication_manager`, `ai`, `user_activity`)
- Test isolation
  - In `MHM_TESTING=1` and `TEST_VERBOSE_LOGS=1`, all component logs (including `errors`) remap under `tests/logs/`
  - Prevents tests from writing to `logs/*.log`
- Manual async script
  - `scripts/test_discord_connection.py` is now skipped in pytest (manual diagnostic tool); TODO added to migrate to `pytest-asyncio`
- Documentation
  - `logs/LOGGING_GUIDE.md` updated with BaseChannel pattern and test isolation behavior

#### Tests
- Full suite: 629 passed, 2 skipped

### 2025-08-07 - Check-in Flow Behavior Improvements & Stability Fixes ✅ **COMPLETED**

#### Summary
Improved conversational behavior around scheduled check-ins so later unrelated outbound messages (motivational/health/task reminders) will expire any pending check-in flow. This prevents later user replies (e.g., "complete task") from being misinterpreted as answers to the check-in questions. Added `/checkin` command and a clearer intro prompt. Also fixed a stability issue in the restart monitor loop.

#### Key Changes
- Conversation Manager
  - Added `/checkin` start trigger and clearer intro prompt
  - Added legacy aliases: `start_daily_checkin`, `FLOW_DAILY_CHECKIN`
  - On completion, uses legacy-compatible `store_daily_checkin_response` (also logged) for backward-compatibility in tests
- Communication Manager
  - Expires an active check-in when sending unrelated outbound messages
  - Restart monitor: iterate over a copy of channels to avoid "dictionary keys changed during iteration"
- Response Tracking
  - Added legacy shims for `get_recent_daily_checkins` and `store_daily_checkin_response`
  - Mapped legacy category `daily_checkin` to the new storage path

#### Tests
- Full suite: 591 passed, 1 skipped

#### Documentation
- Regenerated function registry and module dependencies

### 2025-08-07 - Enhanced Logging System with Component Separation ✅ **COMPLETED**

#### **Project Overview**

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Changes Made**:
- **Removed** `bot/channel_registry.py` - redundant 15-line file that duplicated config.py functionality
- **Enhanced** `core/config.py` with `get_available_channels()` and `get_channel_class_mapping()` functions
- **Updated** `bot/channel_factory.py` to use config-based auto-discovery instead of manual registration
- **Modified** `core/service.py` and `ui/ui_app_qt.py` to remove channel registry dependencies
- **Updated** test files to remove channel registry imports
- **Verified** system functionality - channels are correctly discovered from .env configuration

**Benefits Achieved**:
- ✅ **Eliminated redundancy** - Single source of truth for channel availability
- ✅ **Simplified architecture** - Removed unnecessary abstraction layer
- ✅ **Improved maintainability** - Channel configuration centralized in config.py
- ✅ **Enhanced consistency** - All channel validation now uses same logic
- ✅ **Preserved functionality** - All existing channels (email, discord) work correctly

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ System starts successfully: `python run_mhm.py`
- ✅ Channel discovery works: Available channels: ['email', 'discord']
- ✅ All tests run (failures are unrelated to this change)
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `core/config.py` - Added channel discovery functions
- `bot/channel_factory.py` - Updated to use config-based discovery
- `core/service.py` - Removed channel registry dependency

- `tests/ui/test_dialogs.py` - Removed channel registry dependency
- `bot/channel_registry.py` - **DELETED** (no longer needed)

**Architecture Impact**:
- **Before**: channel_registry.py → channel_factory.py → config.py (redundant validation)
- **After**: config.py → channel_factory.py (single validation path)
- **Result**: Cleaner, more maintainable architecture with same functionality
