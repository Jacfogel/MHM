# MHM System Improvements

## üóìÔ∏è Recent Changes

### 2025-01-08 - Removed Backwards Compatibility for Timestamp Formats
- **Backwards Compatibility Removal**: Systematically removed all Unix timestamp compatibility code from core system
- **Files Modified**: Updated `core/utils.py`, `bot/communication_manager.py`, `bot/user_context_manager.py`, and `core/auto_cleanup.py`
- **Timestamp Functions**: Simplified timestamp parsing functions to only handle human-readable format (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`)
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling with combined ValueError/TypeError catching for timestamp parsing
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed dual-format parsing logic, reducing complexity and potential bugs
- **Verification**: Confirmed all existing timestamps are in human-readable format through comprehensive audit

### Logging System Improvements (2025-01-16)

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**

1. **"Logging system force restarted successfully" Issue**
   - **Problem**: `check_and_fix_logging()` method in `core/service.py` had flawed logic that always triggered force restart
   - **Root Cause**: Method checked file size increase with only 0.2 second delay, not accounting for buffering
   - **Fix**: Improved detection logic with:
     - Longer wait time (0.5 seconds) for file operations
     - Better verification by reading recent log content
     - Checking for recent logging activity within 5 minutes
     - Only restarting when there's clear evidence of failure
   - **Result**: Eliminates unnecessary force restarts during normal operation

2. **"Scheduler running: 0 active jobs scheduled" - Misleading Message**
   - **Problem**: Always showed 0 jobs even when messages were being sent successfully
   - **Root Cause**: Schedule library behavior - jobs scheduled for future times may not appear in `schedule.jobs` until closer to execution
   - **Investigation**: Confirmed scheduler was working correctly (messages were being sent), issue was misleading logging
   - **Fix**: 
     - Updated message to clarify that jobs may not appear until execution time
     - Avoided complex debugging that could break working functionality
   - **Result**: Less confusing status messages while preserving working functionality

3. **Unnecessary Logging Suffixes Cleanup**
   - **Problem**: Messages like "User info loaded (new structure)" and "User info saved (no duplication)" had unnecessary suffixes
   - **Fix**: Removed "(new structure)" and "(no duplication)" suffixes from logging messages in `core/utils.py`
   - **Result**: Cleaner, more professional log messages

**Important Note**: During debugging, we discovered that complex modifications to the scheduler code could break the working functionality. We reverted problematic changes and kept only minimal, safe improvements to maintain system stability.

### Schedule Rescheduling Issue Fix (2025-01-16)

**Issue Identified and Fixed:**

4. **"No scheduler manager available for rescheduling" - Schedule Changes Not Applied**
   - **Problem**: When editing schedule periods through the UI, changes were saved to files but the scheduler wasn't notified to reschedule messages
   - **Root Cause**: UI runs in "UI-only mode" without direct access to the scheduler manager running in the service
   - **Investigation**: The system was designed to work this way, but the communication mechanism between UI and service was missing
   - **Solution**: 
     - Extended existing flag file pattern (similar to test messages) to handle reschedule requests
     - Added `create_reschedule_request()` function in `core/utils.py` to create request files when scheduler manager is not available
     - Added `check_reschedule_requests()` method in `core/service.py` to process reschedule requests every 2 seconds
     - Service now automatically picks up schedule changes made through UI and reschedules accordingly
   - **Result**: Schedule edits through the UI now properly trigger rescheduling in the background service

**Technical Details:**
- Smart detection: Only creates reschedule requests when service is actually running
- If service is stopped, changes are automatically picked up on next startup via `schedule_all_users_immediately()`
- Uses JSON flag files with format: `reschedule_request_{user_id}_{category}_{timestamp}.flag`
- Service processes requests every 2 seconds during normal operation
- Proper user context switching ensures rescheduling happens for the correct user
- Automatic cleanup of processed request files
- Graceful error handling for malformed or inaccessible request files
