## üìù How to Add Improvements

When adding new improvements, follow this format:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD - Brief Title
- **Feature**: What was added/changed
- **Impact**: What this improves or fixes
```

Keep entries **concise** and **scannable**. Focus on **what changed** and **why it matters**. 

### Immediate Action Items (High Priority)
These improvements will make the code more reliable and easier to work with:

2. **Add comprehensive error handling** - Create a system for handling errors gracefully
   - *What it means*: When something goes wrong, the program tells you exactly what happened instead of crashing
   - *Why it helps*: Prevents the app from stopping unexpectedly and helps you fix problems faster

3. **Create testing framework** - Add automated tests for core functions
   - *What it means*: Write small programs that check if your main code works correctly
   - *Why it helps*: You can make changes without worrying about breaking existing features

4. **Add configuration validation** - Check that all required settings are present at startup
   - *What it means*: When the app starts, it checks that all necessary settings are configured
   - *Why it helps*: Prevents mysterious errors caused by missing or incorrect settings

5. **Implement data migration system** - Handle changes to how data is stored
   - *What it means*: When you change how data is saved, the app automatically updates old data to the new format
   - *Why it helps*: You can improve the app without losing your existing data

6. **Add performance monitoring** - Track how long operations take
   - *What it means*: The app keeps track of which operations are slow so you can improve them
   - *Why it helps*: Helps you identify and fix performance problems before they become annoying

7. **Create development guidelines** - Establish coding standards and best practices
   - *What it means*: Write down rules for how code should be written to keep it consistent
   - *Why it helps*: Makes the code easier to read and understand, especially when working with AI assistance

8. **Improve AI terminal interaction reliability** - Address issues with AI misunderstanding terminal output and making incorrect assumptions
   - *What it means*: Investigate why AI assistants often misinterpret PowerShell output, fail to parse command results correctly, or make assumptions about what happened
   - *Why it helps*: Reduces confusion, prevents incorrect conclusions, and improves the reliability of AI-assisted development
   - *Specific issues to investigate*:
     - PowerShell output parsing problems
     - Assumptions about command success/failure
     - Misinterpretation of error messages
     - Failure to properly handle multi-line output
     - Incorrect conclusions about what commands actually did
