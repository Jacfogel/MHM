## 1. **Core Vision**

**MHM (Motivational Health Messages)** is a personal AI-assisted system designed to support individuals with ADHD and depression by helping with executive functioning, emotional support, and day-to-day life management.

The project began as a lightweight reminder and motivation tool and has evolved into a broader exploration of how adaptive, empathetic technology can meaningfully support neurodivergent users-without replacing human relationships or professional care.

MHM is not a clinical system. Its purpose is to **support**, **augment**, and **reduce friction**, not to diagnose, treat, or manage mental health conditions.

---

## 2. **Mission Statement**

**To build an intelligent, empathetic assistant that helps reduce overwhelm, supports executive functioning, and offers emotionally supportive interactions-adapting over time to the user's needs, preferences, and energy levels.**

This mission emphasizes usefulness, safety, and respect for user autonomy over technical novelty.

---

## 3. **Core Values**

### 3.1. **Personalized & Adaptive**

- Adapts to individual preferences, routines, and configuration
- Uses context and history *where available* to improve relevance
- Learns gradually over time through explicit input and observed patterns
- Prioritizes usefulness over complexity

Adaptation is an **ongoing goal**; not all adaptive behaviors are present at all times or in all configurations.

---

### 3.2. **Hope-Focused & Supportive**

- Encourages progress without pressure
- Provides a non-judgmental space for reflection
- Emphasizes forward momentum, even in small steps
- Treats setbacks as part of the process, not failures

Support is offered gently and never coercively.

---

### 3.3. **Executive Functioning Support**

- Helps externalize planning, remembering, and task initiation
- Uses varied approaches (including semi-random timing) to reduce habituation
- Supports routines and habits without rigid enforcement
- Aims to reduce cognitive load, not increase it

This is the core practical value of the system.

---

## 4. **Target Users**

### 4.1. **Primary User: You**

- An adult with ADHD and depression
- Building a personal system to meet real, lived needs
- Values learning, correctness, and clarity over speed
- Prefers direct feedback and correction over hidden inefficiencies

Many design decisions reflect this reality explicitly.

---

### 4.2. **Secondary Users (Potential)**

- Other adults with ADHD and/or depression
- Individuals seeking executive functioning support
- Users who benefit from varied reminders and emotionally aware interactions

Support for secondary users is **aspirational** and may require additional safeguards, onboarding, and configuration.

---

## 5. **Long-Term Goals**

This section outlines **direction**, not guarantees. Status may change over time.

---

### 5.2. **Phase 2: Intelligence Enhancement (In Progress / Partial)**

- More context-aware interactions
- Tone and message adaptation based on user state
- Pattern-informed suggestions
- Improved emotional tracking and response nuance
- Continued refinement of semi-random scheduling

---

### 5.3. **Phase 3: Advanced Assistant Capabilities (Aspirational)**

- Voice-based interaction

- Integration with external systems where appropriate

---

### 5.4. **Phase 4: Product Potential (Optional)**

- Exploration of broader usability
- Scalable architecture for multiple users

---

## 6. **AI Assistant Vision**

This section describes the **intended character and behavior of the MHM system's AI**, not the development AIs assisting with this project.

### 6.1. **Personality & Emotional Traits**

- Calm, supportive, emotionally grounded
- Empathetic without being overbearing
- Helpful, consistent, and user-aligned
- Growth-oriented and respectful of boundaries

---

### 6.2. **Communication Style**

- Clear, direct, conversational language
- Measured tone
- Avoids unnecessary verbosity
- Humor and sass are optional and user-configurable

---

### 6.3. **Cognitive & AI Abilities**

- Context-aware within available data
- Capable of learning from patterns over time
- Able to assist with analysis, planning, and reflection
- Designed to be reliable rather than performative

---

### 6.4. **Functional Roles**

- Reminder and scheduling support
- Task and routine assistance
- Note capture and reflection
- Research and information support
- Communication relay where appropriate

---

### 6.5. **Emotional Intelligence**

- Responds empathetically to expressed emotions
- Adjusts tone based on context and configuration
- Offers encouragement, validation, or humor as appropriate
- Does not manipulate, guilt, or override user agency

---

## 7. **Architectural Philosophy**

### 7.1. **AI-Forward, Not AI-Dependent**

- AI enhances interactions but is not required for core functionality
- The system remains useful even with limited AI capabilities

---

### 7.2. **Adaptive Over Time**

- Semi-random timing to avoid habituation
- Pattern-informed suggestions rather than rigid automation
- Continuous refinement based on real usage

---

### 7.3. **Executive Function First**

- Reduce friction in starting, remembering, and transitioning tasks
- Favor simple, reliable systems over clever but fragile ones

---

### 7.4. **Privacy & Control**

- Local-first where feasible
- User retains control over data and features
- No hidden behavior or silent data use

---

## 8. **User Experience Vision**

The following sections describe **intended interaction patterns**. Some examples are aspirational and depend on available data and configuration.

### 8.1. **Daily Interaction** *(Illustrative Examples)*

1. **Adaptive Check-in**  
   "How are you feeling today?" (tone may vary based on recent context)

2. **Contextual Support**  
   "You've mentioned that walks sometimes help. Would you like to schedule one?" (only when appropriate)

3. **Emotional Response**  
   "It's okay to have tough days. What would help you feel a bit better right now?"

4. **Progress Recognition**  
   "You've been checking in consistently lately. That's meaningful progress."

---

### 8.2. **Executive Functioning Support**

- Varied reminder timing to prevent tuning out

- Support for building and maintaining routines

---

### 8.3. **Emotional Companionship**

- A non-judgmental, supportive presence

## 12. **Call to Action**

This project represents a vision of technology that serves real human needs-not just tasks, but support, understanding, and reduced friction in daily life.

Whether MHM remains a deeply personal tool or grows into something broader, each improvement makes it more capable of helping someone live a little better, with more clarity, support, and self-compassion.

**This is about building something that helps-not something that impresses.**
