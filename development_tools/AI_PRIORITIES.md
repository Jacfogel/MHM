## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Remove unused imports**  -  356 unused imports across 126 files (CRITICAL status).
   - Top files: test_ai_functionality_manual.py (1 imports), test_cache_manager.py (1 imports), test_base_handler_behavior.py (1 imports), test_checkin_handler_behavior.py (1 imports), test_communication_manager_behavior.py (1 imports), ... +1
   - Action: Review and remove unused imports, starting with obvious removals
   - Effort: Small to Medium (review each import, remove safe ones, refactor type-only imports)
   - Why this matters: Unused imports add noise, slow imports, and can hide real dependencies
   - Detailed Report: [UNUSED_IMPORTS_REPORT.md](development_docs/UNUSED_IMPORTS_REPORT.md)
2. **Raise coverage for domains below target**  -  3 key domains remain below the 80% target.
   - Target domains: communication (69.8%, 2643 lines missing), ui (73.0%, 1669 lines missing), core (73.4%, 2558 lines missing)
   - Add scenario tests before the next full audit to lift domain coverage above 80%.
3. **Raise development tools coverage**  -  Development tools coverage is 46.9% (target 60%+).
   - Focus on: run_dev_tools.py (0.0%), data_freshness_audit.py (0.0%), tool_guide.py (0.0%)
   - Strengthen tests in `tests/development_tools/` for fragile helpers.
4. **Refactor high-complexity functions**  -  131 critical-complexity functions (>199 nodes) need immediate attention.
   - Highest complexity: create_backup (backup_manager.py), cleanup_old_backup_files (auto_cleanup.py), _cleanup_old_backups (backup_manager.py)

## Quick Wins
- No immediate quick wins identified. Re-run doc-sync after tackling focus items.

## Watch List
- Overall test coverage is 72.9% (target 80%) (19806 / 27161 statements).
- Development tools coverage is 46.9% (target 60%+).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
