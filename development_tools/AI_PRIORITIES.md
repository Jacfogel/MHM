## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Stabilize documentation drift**  -  1 documentation paths are out of sync.
   - Top offenders: ai_development_docs\AI_SESSION_STARTER.md
   - Action: Fix broken paths in top offender files, then run `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-sync`
   - Effort: Small (update file paths in documentation, run automated fix tool)
   - Why this matters: Broken paths in documentation reduce trust and make navigation difficult
2. **Add error handling to missing functions**  -  3 functions have no error handling.
   - service_utilities.py: 2 functions, message_processing/conversation_flow_manager.py: 1 functions
   - Add error handling decorators or try-except blocks to protect these functions.
   - Specific functions: communication\message_processing\conversation_flow_manager.py:1941 (_date_str), core\service_utilities.py:115 (now_readable_timestamp), core\service_utilities.py:120 (now_filename_timestamp)
   - Effort: Small (add @handle_errors decorator or wrap in try-except)
   - Why this matters: Functions without error handling can crash the application on unexpected errors
3. **Remove obvious unused imports**  -  141 obvious unused import(s) can be safely removed.
   - Top files: cache_manager.py (1 imports), context_builder.py (1 imports), conversation_history.py (1 imports), prompt_manager.py (1 imports), account_handler.py (1 imports), ... +1
   - 141 obvious removals (safe to delete)
   - Note: 29 type-only imports exist but are not recommended for removal (consider TYPE_CHECKING guard if needed)
   - Action: Review and remove obvious unused imports (safe to delete)
   - Effort: Small (remove safe imports identified as obvious unused)
   - Why this matters: Unused imports add noise, slow imports, and can hide real dependencies
   - Detailed Report: [UNUSED_IMPORTS_REPORT.md](development_docs/UNUSED_IMPORTS_REPORT.md)
4. **Raise coverage for domains below target**  -  3 key domains remain below the 80% target.
   - Target domains: communication (69.0%, 2858 lines missing), ui (70.9%, 1968 lines missing), core (74.2%, 2605 lines missing)
   - Action: Add scenario tests for uncovered code paths in target domains
   - Effort: Medium (writing tests for 3 domains requires understanding business logic)
   - Why this matters: Higher test coverage reduces bug risk and improves code maintainability
   - Command: Run `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py audit --full` after adding tests to verify coverage improvement
5. **Raise development tools coverage**  -  Development tools coverage is 40.8% (target 60%+).
   - Focus on: analyze_package_exports.py (0.0%), run_dev_tools.py (0.0%), export_code_snapshot.py (0.0%)
   - Action: Strengthen tests in `tests/development_tools/` for fragile helpers and low-coverage modules
   - Effort: Medium (adding tests for 3 modules requires understanding tool behavior)
   - Why this matters: Development tools need high test coverage to ensure reliability and prevent regressions
   - Command: Run `python run_tests.py --coverage` to verify coverage improvements
6. **Retire remaining legacy references**  -  41 files still depend on legacy compatibility markers.
   - 73 legacy markers still surface during scans.
   - Review development_docs/LEGACY_REFERENCE_REPORT.md for exact locations.
   - Action: Remove legacy compatibility code and update references to use new implementations
   - Effort: Medium (reviewing 41 files and updating references requires testing)
   - Why this matters: Legacy code increases maintenance burden and technical debt
   - Command: `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py legacy` to scan for legacy references
7. **Refactor high-complexity functions**  -  141 critical-complexity functions (>199 nodes) need immediate attention.
   - Highest complexity: generate_response (chatbot.py), generate_contextual_response (chatbot.py), _detect_mode (chatbot.py)
   - Action: Break down complex functions into smaller, focused functions with single responsibilities
   - Effort: Large (refactoring 141 critical functions requires careful analysis and testing)
   - Why this matters: High complexity functions are harder to understand, test, and maintain, increasing bug risk

## Quick Wins
- No immediate quick wins identified. Re-run doc-sync after tackling focus items.

## Watch List
- Overall test coverage is 72.4% (target 80%) (20728 / 28645 statements).
- Development tools coverage is 40.8% (target 60%+).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
