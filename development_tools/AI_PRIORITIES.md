## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Stabilize documentation drift**  -  6 documentation paths are out of sync.
   - Top offenders: development_tools\DEVELOPMENT_TOOLS_GUIDE.md, development_tools\PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENTS.md, development_tools\PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENTS_IMPLEMENTED.md
   - Action: Fix broken paths in top offender files, then run `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-sync --fix`
   - Effort: Small (update file paths in documentation, run automated fix tool)
   - Why this matters: Broken paths in documentation reduce trust and make navigation difficult
2. **Raise coverage for domains below target**  -  3 key domains remain below the 80% target.
   - Target domains: communication (69.7%, 2656 lines missing), ui (73.1%, 1664 lines missing), core (73.6%, 2547 lines missing)
   - Add scenario tests before the next full audit to lift domain coverage above 80%.
3. **Raise development tools coverage**  -  Development tools coverage is 34.6% (target 60%+).
   - Focus on: generate_directory_tree.py (0.0%), analyze_error_handling.py (0.0%), generate_error_handling_recommendations.py (0.0%)
   - Strengthen tests in `tests/development_tools/` for fragile helpers.
4. **Refactor high-complexity functions**  -  131 critical-complexity functions (>199 nodes) need immediate attention.
   - Highest complexity: create_backup (backup_manager.py), cleanup_old_backup_files (auto_cleanup.py), _cleanup_old_backups (backup_manager.py)

## Quick Wins
- Fix 5 ASCII compliance issue(s) in 4 file(s) - run `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-fix --fix-ascii`
- Add file address metadata to 4 file(s) missing addresses - run `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-fix --add-addresses`

## Watch List
- Overall test coverage is 73.0% (target 80%) (19815 / 27162 statements).
- Development tools coverage is 34.6% (target 60%+).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
