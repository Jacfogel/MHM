## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Phase 1: Replace basic try-except with decorators**  -  54 functions have try-except blocks that should use `@handle_errors` decorator.
   - Start with 1 high-priority candidates (entry points and critical operations).
   - Top modules: bot.py (1)
   - Then process 45 medium-priority functions.
   - Apply `@handle_errors` decorator to replace basic try-except blocks.
   - Effort: Medium (requires reviewing each function's error handling needs)
   - Why this matters: Centralized error handling provides consistent logging and recovery patterns
2. **Raise coverage for domains below target**  -  3 key domains remain below the 80% target.
   - Target domains: communication (69.7%, 2655 lines missing), ui (72.5%, 1709 lines missing), core (73.2%, 2588 lines missing)
   - Add scenario tests before the next full audit to lift domain coverage above 80%.
3. **Raise development tools coverage**  -  Development tools coverage is 34.8% (target 60%+).
   - Focus on: generate_directory_tree.py (0.0%), analyze_error_handling.py (0.0%), generate_error_handling_recommendations.py (0.0%)
   - Strengthen tests in `tests/development_tools/` for fragile helpers.
4. **Refactor high-complexity functions**  -  131 critical-complexity functions (>199 nodes) need immediate attention.
   - Highest complexity: create_backup (backup_manager.py), cleanup_old_backup_files (auto_cleanup.py), _cleanup_old_backups (backup_manager.py)

## Quick Wins
- Fix 3 ASCII compliance issue(s) in 2 file(s) - run `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-fix --fix-ascii`

## Watch List
- Overall test coverage is 72.7% (target 80%) (19797 / 27224 statements).
- Development tools coverage is 34.8% (target 60%+).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
