## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Raise coverage for low-performing domains**  -  3 key domains remain below the 80% target.
   - Target domains: tasks (60.5%, 234 lines missing), communication (66.2%, 2985 lines missing), ui (69.5%, 1904 lines missing)
   - Add scenario tests before the next full audit to lift domain coverage above 80%.
2. **Raise development tools coverage**  -  Development tools coverage is 27.7% (target 60%+).
   - Focus on: analyze_ai_work.py (0.0%), analyze_documentation.py (0.0%), analyze_missing_addresses.py (0.0%)
   - Strengthen tests in `tests/development_tools/` for fragile helpers.
3. **Refactor high-complexity functions**  -  128 critical-complexity functions (>199 nodes) need immediate attention.
4. **Review completed TODO entries**  -  3 completed entry/entries in TODO.md need review for changelog.
   - Review completed entries in TODO.md
   - If already documented in changelogs, remove from TODO.md
   - If not documented, move to CHANGELOG_DETAIL.md and AI_CHANGELOG.md first, then remove from TODO.md

## Quick Wins
- No immediate quick wins identified. Re-run doc-sync after tackling focus items.

## Watch List
- Overall test coverage is 69.4% (target 80%) (18783 / 27081 statements).
- Development tools coverage is 27.7% (target 60%+). Focus on analyze_ai_work.py (0.0%), analyze_documentation.py (0.0%), ... +1.
