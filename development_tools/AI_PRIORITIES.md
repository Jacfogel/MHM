## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Remove unused imports**  -  436 unused imports across 151 files (CRITICAL status).
   - 134 obvious removals (safe to delete)
   - 2 type-only imports (consider TYPE_CHECKING guard)
   - Top files: account_handler.py (1 imports), webhook_handler.py (1 imports), webhook_server.py (1 imports), welcome_handler.py (1 imports), welcome_manager.py (1 imports), ... +1
   - Action: Review and remove unused imports, starting with obvious removals
   - Effort: Small to Medium (review each import, remove safe ones, refactor type-only imports)
   - Why this matters: Unused imports add noise, slow imports, and can hide real dependencies
   - Detailed Report: [UNUSED_IMPORTS_REPORT.md](development_docs/UNUSED_IMPORTS_REPORT.md)
2. **Raise coverage for domains below target**  -  3 key domains remain below the 80% target.
   - Target domains: communication (69.8%, 2645 lines missing), ui (73.2%, 1659 lines missing), core (73.4%, 2558 lines missing)
   - Add scenario tests before the next full audit to lift domain coverage above 80%.
3. **Raise development tools coverage**  -  Development tools coverage is 34.7% (target 60%+).
   - Focus on: generate_directory_tree.py (0.0%), analyze_error_handling.py (0.0%), generate_error_handling_recommendations.py (0.0%)
   - Strengthen tests in `tests/development_tools/` for fragile helpers.
4. **Add pytest category markers to tests**  -  8 tests are missing pytest category markers.
   - Top files: test_schemas_validation.py (5 tests), test_path_drift_detection.py (3 tests)
   - Action: Add pytest category markers to tests missing them
   - Effort: Small (run automated fix tool or add markers manually)
   - Why this matters: Category markers help organize tests and enable selective test execution
   - Command: `python development_tools/tests/fix_test_markers.py`
5. **Refactor high-complexity functions**  -  131 critical-complexity functions (>199 nodes) need immediate attention.
   - Highest complexity: create_backup (backup_manager.py), cleanup_old_backup_files (auto_cleanup.py), _cleanup_old_backups (backup_manager.py)

## Quick Wins
- Fix 2 ASCII compliance issue(s) in 2 file(s) - run `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-fix --fix-ascii`

## Watch List
- Overall test coverage is 73.0% (target 80%) (19827 / 27162 statements).
- Development tools coverage is 34.7% (target 60%+).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
