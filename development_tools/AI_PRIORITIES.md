## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Add docstrings to missing functions**  -  18 functions are missing docstrings (1490 total, 1404 documented).
   - Top functions: _normalize_days (schemas.py), _normalize_periods (schemas.py), _normalize_flags (schemas.py), __init__ (account_flow_handler.py), __init__ (logger.py), ... +13 more
   - Action: Add docstrings to functions missing them
   - Effort: Medium (requires understanding each function's purpose and parameters)
   - Why this matters: Docstrings help AI collaborators and future developers understand code intent
2. **Add error handling to missing functions**  -  7 functions have no error handling.
   - root: 7 functions
   - Add error handling decorators or try-except blocks to protect these functions.
   - Specific functions: run_mhm.py:20 (resolve_python_interpreter), run_mhm.py:45 (prepare_launch_environment), run_tests.py:255 (setup_test_logger)
   - Effort: Small (add @handle_errors decorator or wrap in try-except)
   - Why this matters: Functions without error handling can crash the application on unexpected errors
3. **Add docstrings to handler classes**  -  14 handler classes missing class docstrings.
   - Top handlers: TaskManagementHandler (interaction_handlers.py, 26 methods), TaskManagementHandler (task_handler.py, 25 methods), AnalyticsHandler (analytics_handler.py, 18 methods), AnalyticsHandler (interaction_handlers.py, 14 methods), ScheduleManagementHandler (interaction_handlers.py, 11 methods), ... +9 more
   - Action: Add class-level docstrings to handler classes (e.g., class AccountManagementHandler: """Handler for...""")
4. **Phase 1: Replace basic try-except with decorators**  -  93 functions have try-except blocks that should use `@handle_errors` decorator.
   - Start with 31 high-priority candidates (entry points and critical operations).
   - Top modules: interaction_handlers.py (8), bot.py (8), ui_app_qt.py (3)
   - Then process 54 medium-priority functions.
   - Apply `@handle_errors` decorator to replace basic try-except blocks.
   - Effort: Medium (requires reviewing each function's error handling needs)
   - Why this matters: Centralized error handling provides consistent logging and recovery patterns
5. **Raise coverage for domains below target**  -  3 key domains remain below the 80% target.
   - Target domains: communication (68.4%, 2797 lines missing), ui (70.4%, 1851 lines missing), core (71.5%, 2684 lines missing)
   - Add scenario tests before the next full audit to lift domain coverage above 80%.
6. **Raise development tools coverage**  -  Development tools coverage is 36.9% (target 60%+).
   - Focus on: generate_directory_tree.py (0.0%), analyze_error_handling.py (0.0%), generate_error_handling_recommendations.py (0.0%)
   - Strengthen tests in `tests/development_tools/` for fragile helpers.
7. **Retire remaining legacy references**  -  11 files still depend on legacy compatibility markers.
   - 25 legacy markers still surface during scans.
   - Review development_docs/LEGACY_REFERENCE_REPORT.md for exact locations.
   - Use `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py legacy` to scan for legacy references.
8. **Refactor high-complexity functions**  -  128 critical-complexity functions (>199 nodes) need immediate attention.
   - Highest complexity: get_mood_trends (checkin_analytics.py), get_energy_trends (checkin_analytics.py), _cleanup_old_backups (backup_manager.py)

## Quick Wins
- No immediate quick wins identified. Re-run doc-sync after tackling focus items.

## Watch List
- Overall test coverage is 71.2% (target 80%) (19290 / 27108 statements).
- Development tools coverage is 36.9% (target 60%+).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
