## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Raise coverage for low-performing modules**  -  3 key modules remain below the 80% target.
   - Target modules: ui (63.6%, 2271 lines missing), tasks (65.6%, 204 lines missing), core (67.8%, 3023 lines missing)
   - Add scenario tests before the next full audit to lift module coverage above 80%.
2. **Raise development tools coverage**  -  Development tools coverage is 20.6% (target 60%+).
   - Focus on: validate_ai_work.py (0.0%), analyze_documentation.py (0.0%), version_sync.py (0.0%)
   - Strengthen tests in `tests/development_tools/` for fragile helpers.
3. **Refactor high-complexity functions**  -  128 critical-complexity functions (>199 nodes) need immediate attention.
   - Then address 138 high-complexity functions (100-199 nodes).
   - Refactor to reduce cyclomatic complexity and improve maintainability.

## Quick Wins
- No immediate quick wins identified. Re-run doc-sync after tackling focus items.

## Watch List
- Documentation coverage sits at 93.69% (target 90%).
- Overall test coverage is 67.6% (18317 / 27081 statements).
- Development tools coverage is 20.6% (target 60%+). Focus on validate_ai_work.py (0.0%), analyze_documentation.py (0.0%), ... +1.
- Keep an eye on untested files: ui/dialogs/task_completion_dialog.py (21.9%), core/message_analytics.py (25.8%).

## Follow-up Commands
