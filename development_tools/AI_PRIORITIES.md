## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Stabilize documentation drift**  -  16 documentation paths are out of sync.
   - Top offenders: Heading Numbering Issues, development_tools\AI_DEV_TOOLS_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md, communication\communication_channels\discord\DISCORD_GUIDE.md, ... +3
   - Run `python development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py doc-sync --fix` after adjustments.
2. **Phase 1: Replace basic try-except with decorators**  -  88 functions have try-except blocks that should use `@handle_errors` decorator.
   - Start with 26 high-priority candidates (entry points and critical operations).
   - Then process 38 medium-priority functions.
   - Apply `@handle_errors` decorator to replace basic try-except blocks.
3. **Phase 2: Categorize generic exceptions**  -  1 generic exception raises need categorization into MHMError subclasses.
   - Most common: 1 ValueError
   - Replace generic exceptions (ValueError, Exception, KeyError, TypeError) with specific MHMError subclasses.
   - See `ai_development_docs/AI_ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md` for categorization rules.
4. **Raise coverage for low-performing modules**  -  3 key modules remain below the 80% target.
   - Target modules: communication (68.9%, 2725 lines missing), ui (71.3%, 1790 lines missing), core (73.2%, 2504 lines missing)
   - Add scenario tests before the next full audit to lift module coverage above 80%.
5. **Retire remaining legacy references**  -  5 files still depend on legacy compatibility markers.
   - 1 legacy markers still surface during scans.
   - Review C:\Users\Julie\projects\MHM\MHM\development_docs\LEGACY_REFERENCE_REPORT.md for exact locations.
   - Use `python development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py legacy --apply` to replace deprecated helpers.

## Quick Wins
- Normalize 11 file(s) with non-ASCII characters via doc-sync.

## Watch List
- Documentation coverage sits at 93.58% (target 90%).
- Overall test coverage is 72.1% (19416 / 26931 statements).
- Keep an eye on untested files: communication/communication_channels/discord/bot.py (45.3%), ui/ui_app_qt.py (49.9%).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py legacy --apply`  -  update legacy references in-place.
- `python development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
