## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Stabilize documentation drift**  -  6 documentation paths are out of sync.
   - Top offenders: TODO.md
   - Action: Fix broken paths in top offender files, then run `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-sync --fix`
   - Effort: Small (update file paths in documentation, run automated fix tool)
   - Why this matters: Broken paths in documentation reduce trust and make navigation difficult
2. **Raise coverage for domains below target**  -  3 key domains remain below the 80% target.
   - Target domains: communication (69.4%, 2681 lines missing), ui (71.1%, 1786 lines missing), core (71.4%, 2751 lines missing)
   - Action: Add scenario tests for uncovered code paths in target domains
   - Effort: Medium (writing tests for 3 domains requires understanding business logic)
   - Why this matters: Higher test coverage reduces bug risk and improves code maintainability
   - Command: Run `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py audit --full` after adding tests to verify coverage improvement
3. **Raise development tools coverage**  -  Development tools coverage is 46.3% (target 60%+).
   - Focus on: analyze_system_signals.py (0.0%), run_dev_tools.py (0.0%), data_freshness_audit.py (0.0%)
   - Action: Strengthen tests in `tests/development_tools/` for fragile helpers and low-coverage modules
   - Effort: Medium (adding tests for 3 modules requires understanding tool behavior)
   - Why this matters: Development tools need high test coverage to ensure reliability and prevent regressions
   - Command: Run `python run_tests.py --coverage` to verify coverage improvements
4. **Remove obvious unused imports**  -  1 obvious unused import(s) can be safely removed.
   - Top files: generate_test_coverage_report.py (1 imports), test_ai_functionality_manual.py (1 imports), test_cache_manager.py (1 imports), test_base_handler_behavior.py (1 imports), test_checkin_handler_behavior.py (1 imports), ... +1
   - 1 obvious removals (safe to delete)
   - Action: Review and remove obvious unused imports (safe to delete)
   - Effort: Small (remove safe imports identified as obvious unused)
   - Why this matters: Unused imports add noise, slow imports, and can hide real dependencies
   - Detailed Report: [UNUSED_IMPORTS_REPORT.md](development_docs/UNUSED_IMPORTS_REPORT.md)
5. **Retire remaining legacy references**  -  8 files still depend on legacy compatibility markers.
   - 24 legacy markers still surface during scans.
   - Review development_docs/LEGACY_REFERENCE_REPORT.md for exact locations.
   - Action: Remove legacy compatibility code and update references to use new implementations
   - Effort: Medium (reviewing 8 files and updating references requires testing)
   - Why this matters: Legacy code increases maintenance burden and technical debt
   - Command: `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py legacy` to scan for legacy references
6. **Refactor high-complexity functions**  -  131 critical-complexity functions (>199 nodes) need immediate attention.
   - Highest complexity: cleanup_old_backup_files (auto_cleanup.py), _cleanup_old_backups (backup_manager.py), restore_backup (backup_manager.py)
   - Action: Break down complex functions into smaller, focused functions with single responsibilities
   - Effort: Large (refactoring 131 critical functions requires careful analysis and testing)
   - Why this matters: High complexity functions are harder to understand, test, and maintain, increasing bug risk

## Quick Wins
- Fix 1 ASCII compliance issue(s) in 1 file(s) - run `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-fix --fix-ascii`
- Convert 2 unconverted link(s) in 1 file(s) - run `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-fix --convert-links`

## Watch List
- Overall test coverage is 71.6% (target 80%) (19467 / 27172 statements).
- Development tools coverage is 46.3% (target 60%+).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
