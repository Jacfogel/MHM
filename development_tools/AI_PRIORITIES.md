## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Raise coverage for domains below target**  -  3 key domains remain below the 80% target.
   - Target domains: communication (69.2%, 2896 lines missing), ui (70.6%, 1971 lines missing), core (73.2%, 2789 lines missing)
   - Action: Add scenario tests for uncovered code paths in target domains
   - Effort: Medium (writing tests for 3 domains requires understanding business logic)
   - Why this matters: Higher test coverage reduces bug risk and improves code maintainability
   - Command: Run `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py audit --full` after adding tests to verify coverage improvement
2. **Raise development tools coverage**  -  Development tools coverage is 41.7% (target 60%+).
   - Focus on: export_code_snapshot.py (0.0%), export_docs_snapshot.py (0.0%), data_freshness_audit.py (0.0%)
   - Action: Strengthen tests in `tests/development_tools/` for fragile helpers and low-coverage modules
   - Effort: Medium (adding tests for 3 modules requires understanding tool behavior)
   - Why this matters: Development tools need high test coverage to ensure reliability and prevent regressions
   - Command: Run `python run_tests.py --coverage` to verify coverage improvements
3. **Investigate possible duplicate functions/methods**  -  21 potential duplicate groups across 19 files.
   - Group 1 (3 funcs, max score 0.943): TextMessageFormatter.format_message (message_formatter.py), EmailMessageFormatter.format_message (message_formatter.py), MessageFormatter.format_message (message_formatter.py)
   - Group 2 (3 funcs, max score 0.9): DiscordRichFormatter.get_color_for_type (rich_formatter.py), EmailRichFormatter.get_color_for_type (rich_formatter.py), RichFormatter.get_color_for_type (rich_formatter.py)
   - Group 3 (3 funcs, max score 0.8): UserDataManager.get_user_data_summary (user_data_manager.py), get_user_data_summary (user_data_manager.py), UserDataManager._get_user_data_summary__initialize_summary (user_data_manager.py)
4. **Retire remaining legacy references**  -  3 files still depend on legacy compatibility markers.
   - 4 legacy markers still surface during scans.
   - Review development_docs/LEGACY_REFERENCE_REPORT.md for exact locations.
   - Action: Remove legacy compatibility code and update references to use new implementations
   - Effort: Medium (reviewing 3 files and updating references requires testing)
   - Why this matters: Legacy code increases maintenance burden and technical debt
   - Command: `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py legacy` to scan for legacy references
5. **Refactor high-complexity functions**  -  142 critical-complexity functions (>199 nodes) need immediate attention.
   - Highest complexity: generate_response (chatbot.py), generate_contextual_response (chatbot.py), _detect_mode (chatbot.py)
   - Action: Break down complex functions into smaller, focused functions with single responsibilities
   - Effort: Large (refactoring 142 critical functions requires careful analysis and testing)
   - Why this matters: High complexity functions are harder to understand, test, and maintain, increasing bug risk

## Quick Wins
- Convert 7 unconverted link(s) in 2 file(s) - run `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-fix --convert-links`

## Watch List
- Overall test coverage is 72.1% (target 80%) (21389 / 29675 statements).
- Development tools coverage is 41.7% (target 60%+).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
