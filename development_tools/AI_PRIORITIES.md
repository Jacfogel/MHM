## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Add documentation to missing functions**  -  86 functions are missing documentation (1490 total, 1404 documented).
   - Add docstrings to functions missing them. Regenerate registry entries via `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py docs`.
2. **Phase 1: Replace basic try-except with decorators**  -  89 functions have try-except blocks that should use `@handle_errors` decorator.
   - Start with 29 high-priority candidates (entry points and critical operations).
   - Then process 53 medium-priority functions.
   - Apply `@handle_errors` decorator to replace basic try-except blocks.
3. **Phase 2: Categorize generic exceptions**  -  1 generic exception raises need categorization into project-specific error classes.
   - Most common: 1 ValueError
   - Replace generic exceptions (ValueError, Exception, KeyError, TypeError) with specific project error classes.
   - See `ai_development_docs/AI_ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md` for categorization rules.
4. **Raise coverage for low-performing domains**  -  3 key domains remain below the 80% target.
   - Target domains: tasks (60.5%, 234 lines missing), communication (66.2%, 2985 lines missing), ui (69.5%, 1904 lines missing)
   - Add scenario tests before the next full audit to lift domain coverage above 80%.
5. **Raise development tools coverage**  -  Development tools coverage is 27.7% (target 60%+).
   - Focus on: analyze_ai_work.py (0.0%), analyze_documentation.py (0.0%), analyze_missing_addresses.py (0.0%)
   - Strengthen tests in `tests/development_tools/` for fragile helpers.
6. **Refresh dependency documentation**  -  1 module dependencies are undocumented.
   - Affected files: tests/development_tools/test_path_drift_detection.py
   - Regenerate dependencies via `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py docs` and rerun the audit.
7. **Retire remaining legacy references**  -  10 files still depend on legacy compatibility markers.
   - 28 legacy markers still surface during scans.
   - Review development_docs/LEGACY_REFERENCE_REPORT.md for exact locations.
   - Use `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py legacy --apply` to replace deprecated helpers.
8. **Refactor high-complexity functions**  -  128 critical-complexity functions (>199 nodes) need immediate attention.
9. **Review completed TODO entries**  -  3 completed entry/entries in TODO.md need review for changelog.
   - Review completed entries in TODO.md
   - If already documented in changelogs, remove from TODO.md
   - If not documented, move to CHANGELOG_DETAIL.md and AI_CHANGELOG.md first, then remove from TODO.md

## Quick Wins
- Resolve 1 paired doc sync issue(s). Start with: ai_development_docs/AI_DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md has sections missing in DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md: {'10. Standard Audit Recipe'}

## Watch List
- Overall test coverage is 69.4% (target 80%) (18783 / 27081 statements).
- Development tools coverage is 27.7% (target 60%+). Focus on analyze_ai_work.py (0.0%), analyze_documentation.py (0.0%), ... +1.

## Follow-up Commands
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py legacy --apply`  -  update legacy references in-place.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
