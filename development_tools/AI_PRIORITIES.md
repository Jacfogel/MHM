## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Remove obvious unused imports**  -  117 obvious unused import(s) can be safely removed.
   - Top files: notebook_handler.py (1 imports), schedule_handler.py (1 imports), task_handler.py (1 imports), command_registry.py (1 imports), message_formatter.py (1 imports), ... +1
   - 117 obvious removals (safe to delete)
   - Note: 24 type-only imports exist but are not recommended for removal (consider TYPE_CHECKING guard if needed)
   - Action: Review and remove obvious unused imports (safe to delete)
   - Effort: Small (remove safe imports identified as obvious unused)
   - Why this matters: Unused imports add noise, slow imports, and can hide real dependencies
   - Detailed Report: [UNUSED_IMPORTS_REPORT.md](development_docs/UNUSED_IMPORTS_REPORT.md)
2. **Raise coverage for domains below target**  -  3 key domains remain below the 80% target.
   - Target domains: communication (68.9%, 2820 lines missing), ui (70.6%, 1984 lines missing), core (73.9%, 2659 lines missing)
   - Action: Add scenario tests for uncovered code paths in target domains
   - Effort: Medium (writing tests for 3 domains requires understanding business logic)
   - Why this matters: Higher test coverage reduces bug risk and improves code maintainability
   - Command: Run `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py audit --full` after adding tests to verify coverage improvement
3. **Raise development tools coverage**  -  Development tools coverage is 39.9% (target 60%+).
   - Focus on: analyze_duplicate_functions.py (0.0%), analyze_package_exports.py (0.0%), run_dev_tools.py (0.0%)
   - Action: Strengthen tests in `tests/development_tools/` for fragile helpers and low-coverage modules
   - Effort: Medium (adding tests for 3 modules requires understanding tool behavior)
   - Why this matters: Development tools need high test coverage to ensure reliability and prevent regressions
   - Command: Run `python run_tests.py --coverage` to verify coverage improvements
4. **Investigate possible duplicate functions/methods**  -  25 potential duplicate groups across 15 files.
   - Group 1 (3 funcs, max score 0.943): TextMessageFormatter.format_message (message_formatter.py), EmailMessageFormatter.format_message (message_formatter.py), MessageFormatter.format_message (message_formatter.py)
   - Group 2 (3 funcs, max score 0.914): CheckinSettingsWidget.add_new_period (checkin_settings_widget.py), TaskSettingsWidget.add_new_period (task_settings_widget.py), ScheduleEditorDialog.add_new_period (schedule_editor_dialog.py)
   - Group 3 (3 funcs, max score 0.914): CheckinSettingsWidget.remove_period_row (checkin_settings_widget.py), TaskSettingsWidget.remove_period_row (task_settings_widget.py), ScheduleEditorDialog.remove_period_row (schedule_editor_dialog.py)
5. **Retire remaining legacy references**  -  40 files still depend on legacy compatibility markers.
   - 72 legacy markers still surface during scans.
   - Review development_docs/LEGACY_REFERENCE_REPORT.md for exact locations.
   - Action: Remove legacy compatibility code and update references to use new implementations
   - Effort: Medium (reviewing 40 files and updating references requires testing)
   - Why this matters: Legacy code increases maintenance burden and technical debt
   - Command: `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py legacy` to scan for legacy references
6. **Refactor high-complexity functions**  -  141 critical-complexity functions (>199 nodes) need immediate attention.
   - Highest complexity: generate_response (chatbot.py), generate_contextual_response (chatbot.py), _detect_mode (chatbot.py)
   - Action: Break down complex functions into smaller, focused functions with single responsibilities
   - Effort: Large (refactoring 141 critical functions requires careful analysis and testing)
   - Why this matters: High complexity functions are harder to understand, test, and maintain, increasing bug risk

## Quick Wins
- No immediate quick wins identified. Re-run doc-sync after tackling focus items.

## Watch List
- Overall test coverage is 72.1% (target 80%) (20591 / 28542 statements).
- Development tools coverage is 39.9% (target 60%+).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
