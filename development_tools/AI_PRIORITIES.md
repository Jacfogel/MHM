## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Raise coverage for domains below target**  -  3 key domains remain below the 80% target.
   - Target domains: communication (69.6%, 2665 lines missing), ui (73.1%, 1664 lines missing), core (73.5%, 2549 lines missing)
   - Add scenario tests before the next full audit to lift domain coverage above 80%.
2. **Raise development tools coverage**  -  Development tools coverage is 34.7% (target 60%+).
   - Focus on: generate_directory_tree.py (0.0%), analyze_error_handling.py (0.0%), generate_error_handling_recommendations.py (0.0%)
   - Strengthen tests in `tests/development_tools/` for fragile helpers.
3. **Refactor high-complexity functions**  -  131 critical-complexity functions (>199 nodes) need immediate attention.

## Quick Wins
- No immediate quick wins identified. Re-run doc-sync after tackling focus items.

## Watch List
- Overall test coverage is 72.9% (target 80%) (19800 / 27162 statements).
- Development tools coverage is 34.7% (target 60%+).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
