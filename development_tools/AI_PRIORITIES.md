## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Add docstrings to missing functions**  -  86 functions are missing docstrings (1490 total, 1404 documented).
   - Action: Add docstrings to functions missing them
   - Effort: Medium (requires understanding each function's purpose and parameters)
   - Why this matters: Docstrings help AI collaborators and future developers understand code intent
2. **Phase 1: Replace basic try-except with decorators**  -  53 functions have try-except blocks that should use `@handle_errors` decorator.
   - Process 45 medium-priority functions.
   - Top modules: channel_orchestrator.py (13), task_crud_dialog.py (9), service.py (5)
   - Apply `@handle_errors` decorator to replace basic try-except blocks.
   - Effort: Medium (requires reviewing each function's error handling needs)
   - Why this matters: Centralized error handling provides consistent logging and recovery patterns
3. **Raise coverage for domains below target**  -  3 key domains remain below the 80% target.
   - Target domains: communication (68.9%, 2732 lines missing), ui (70.4%, 1848 lines missing), core (71.2%, 2710 lines missing)
   - Add scenario tests before the next full audit to lift domain coverage above 80%.
4. **Raise development tools coverage**  -  Development tools coverage is 36.9% (target 60%+).
   - Focus on: generate_directory_tree.py (0.0%), analyze_error_handling.py (0.0%), generate_error_handling_recommendations.py (0.0%)
   - Strengthen tests in `tests/development_tools/` for fragile helpers.
5. **Retire remaining legacy references**  -  11 files still depend on legacy compatibility markers.
   - 25 legacy markers still surface during scans.
   - Review development_docs/LEGACY_REFERENCE_REPORT.md for exact locations.
   - Use `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py legacy` to scan for legacy references.
6. **Refactor high-complexity functions**  -  127 critical-complexity functions (>199 nodes) need immediate attention.
   - Highest complexity: get_mood_trends (checkin_analytics.py), get_energy_trends (checkin_analytics.py), _cleanup_old_backups (backup_manager.py)

## Quick Wins
- No immediate quick wins identified. Re-run doc-sync after tackling focus items.

## Watch List
- Overall test coverage is 71.2% (target 80%) (19267 / 27048 statements).
- Development tools coverage is 36.9% (target 60%+).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
