## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Raise coverage for domains below target**  -  3 key domains remain below the 80% target.
   - Target domains: communication (63.6%, 3655 lines missing), ui (70.4%, 1989 lines missing), core (73.3%, 2681 lines missing)
   - Action: Add scenario tests for uncovered code paths in target domains
   - Effort: Medium (writing tests for 3 domains requires understanding business logic)
   - Why this matters: Higher test coverage reduces bug risk and improves code maintainability
   - Command: Run `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py audit --full` after adding tests to verify coverage improvement
2. **Raise development tools coverage**  -  Development tools coverage is 41.4% (target 60%+).
   - Focus on: analyze_package_exports.py (0.0%), analyze_system_signals.py (0.0%), run_dev_tools.py (0.0%)
   - Action: Strengthen tests in `tests/development_tools/` for fragile helpers and low-coverage modules
   - Effort: Medium (adding tests for 3 modules requires understanding tool behavior)
   - Why this matters: Development tools need high test coverage to ensure reliability and prevent regressions
   - Command: Run `python run_tests.py --coverage` to verify coverage improvements
3. **Retire remaining legacy references**  -  9 files still depend on legacy compatibility markers.
   - 25 legacy markers still surface during scans.
   - Review development_docs/LEGACY_REFERENCE_REPORT.md for exact locations.
   - Action: Remove legacy compatibility code and update references to use new implementations
   - Effort: Medium (reviewing 9 files and updating references requires testing)
   - Why this matters: Legacy code increases maintenance burden and technical debt
   - Command: `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py legacy` to scan for legacy references
4. **Refactor high-complexity functions**  -  145 critical-complexity functions (>199 nodes) need immediate attention.
   - Highest complexity: cleanup_old_backup_files (auto_cleanup.py), _cleanup_old_backups (backup_manager.py), restore_backup (backup_manager.py)
   - Action: Break down complex functions into smaller, focused functions with single responsibilities
   - Effort: Large (refactoring 145 critical functions requires careful analysis and testing)
   - Why this matters: High complexity functions are harder to understand, test, and maintain, increasing bug risk

## Quick Wins
- No immediate quick wins identified. Re-run doc-sync after tackling focus items.

## Watch List
- Overall test coverage is 70.0% (target 80%) (20527 / 29344 statements).
- Development tools coverage is 41.4% (target 60%+).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
