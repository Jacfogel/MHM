## Immediate Focus (Ranked)
1. **Stabilize documentation drift**  -  30 documentation paths are out of sync.
   - Top offenders: development_tools\DEVELOPMENT_TOOLS_GUIDE.md, TODO.md, ai_development_docs\AI_TESTING_GUIDE.md, ... +2
   - Run `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-sync --fix` after adjustments.
2. **Phase 1: Replace basic try-except with decorators**  -  89 functions have try-except blocks that should use `@handle_errors` decorator.
   - Start with 29 high-priority candidates (entry points and critical operations).
   - Then process 53 medium-priority functions.
   - Apply `@handle_errors` decorator to replace basic try-except blocks.
3. **Phase 2: Categorize generic exceptions**  -  1 generic exception raises need categorization into project-specific error classes.
   - Most common: 1 ValueError
   - Replace generic exceptions (ValueError, Exception, KeyError, TypeError) with specific project error classes.
   - See `ai_development_docs/AI_ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md` for categorization rules.
4. **Raise coverage for low-performing modules**  -  3 key modules remain below the 80% target.
   - Target modules: communication (68.4%, 2796 lines missing), ui (69.5%, 1904 lines missing), core (71.4%, 2689 lines missing)
   - Add scenario tests before the next full audit to lift module coverage above 80%.
5. **Raise development tools coverage**  -  Development tools coverage is 28.9% (target 60%+).
   - Focus on: analyze_ai_work.py (0.0%), analyze_documentation.py (0.0%), analyze_missing_addresses.py (0.0%)
   - Strengthen tests in `tests/development_tools/` for fragile helpers.
6. **Retire remaining legacy references**  -  7 files still depend on legacy compatibility markers.
   - 1 legacy markers still surface during scans.
   - Review C:\Users\Julie\projects\MHM\MHM\development_docs\LEGACY_REFERENCE_REPORT.md for exact locations.
   - Use `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py legacy --apply` to replace deprecated helpers.
7. **Refactor high-complexity functions**  -  321 critical-complexity functions (>199 nodes) need immediate attention.
   - Then address 376 high-complexity functions (100-199 nodes).
   - Refactor to reduce cyclomatic complexity and improve maintainability.

## Quick Wins
- No immediate quick wins identified. Re-run doc-sync after tackling focus items.
- **Documentation Consolidation**: 2 file groups could be consolidated to reduce redundancy
  - Development Workflow: Consider merging 15 files (DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md, development_docs/CHANGELOG_DETAIL.md...)
  - Testing: Consider merging 5 files (ai_development_docs/AI_TESTING_GUIDE.md, tests/TESTING_GUIDE.md...)

## Watch List
- Documentation coverage sits at 94.23% (target 90%).
- Overall test coverage is 70.9% (19199 / 27081 statements).
- Development tools coverage is 28.9% (target 60%+). Focus on analyze_ai_work.py (0.0%), analyze_documentation.py (0.0%), ... +1.
- Keep an eye on untested files: communication/communication_channels/discord/bot.py (45.3%), ui/ui_app_qt.py (48.3%).

## Follow-up Commands
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py doc-sync`  -  refresh drift, pairing, and ASCII metrics.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py legacy --apply`  -  update legacy references in-place.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py audit --full`  -  rebuild coverage and hygiene data after fixes.
- `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py status`  -  confirm the latest health snapshot.
