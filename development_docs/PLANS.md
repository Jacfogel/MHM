**Effort**: Small  
**Date**: 2025-09-28

**Objective**: Fix schedule editor dialog creating test files in real data directory instead of test directory.

**Background**: User discovered test files being created in the real `data/requests/` directory instead of the test directory, causing clutter and potential data pollution. Files like `reschedule_test_schedule_editor_motivational_20250928_013553_339902.json` were accumulating in the real data directory.

**Implementation Plan**:

### **2025-09-06 - Intermittent Test Failures (Import Order/Loader Registry)** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Effort**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: Test fixtures; core user data handlers

**Objective**: Eliminate cross-suite intermittents in "all" runs caused by split `USER_DATA_LOADERS` dicts and late registration.

**Actions**:
- Add session-start guard fixture in `tests/conftest.py` to assert shared loader dict identity and register defaults once
- Remove remaining `sys.path` hacks; centralize a single path insert in `tests/conftest.py`
- Improve test isolation: cleanup custom loader registration test; filter non-core types in nonexistent-user assertions
- Allow known feature dir `tasks` in lifecycle test expectations

**Result**: Suite stable across all modes (1141 passed, 1 skipped)

**Follow-ups**:
- Monitor for new tests reintroducing path/env inconsistencies

### **2025-09-05 - Test Suite Stabilization (Temp/Env/Fixtures)** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: None

**Objective**: Eliminate intermittent failures by standardizing temp dirs, env handling, and user data loader registration across the suite.

**Background**: Failures varied depending on execution path. Root issues were conflicting temp dir fixtures, direct env mutations, and loader timing.

**Stabilization Actions**:
- Session-wide temp routing to `tests/data` with path sanitizer
- Env guard fixture and `monkeypatch.setenv` adoption
- Per-test `test_path_factory` for isolated directories
- Session-time user data loader registration; per-test reinforcement
- Fixture injection fixes (request.getfixturevalue / autouse)

**Result**: Full suite green (1141 passed, 1 skipped). Behavior/UI subsets stable.

**Files Affected**:
- Test fixtures and configuration in `tests/conftest.py`
- User data handling in `core/user_data_handlers.py`
- Test execution scripts in `run_tests.py`

**Dependencies**: None - this is a core system investigation

**Timeline**: Immediate investigation required to understand root cause and determine appropriate fix strategy

## 📚 **Reference Information**

### **Key UI Patterns**
- **Widget → Dialog → Core**: Data flows from widgets through dialogs to core handlers
- **Validation**: Centralized validation in `core/user_data_validation.py`
- **Error Handling**: `@handle_errors` decorator with user-friendly messages
- **Signal-Based Updates**: UI updates triggered by data changes

### **Development Guidelines**
- **UI Files**: Create .ui files in `ui/designs/` and generate Python with pyside6-uic
- **Testing**: Use behavior tests that verify side effects and real functionality
- **Legacy Code**: Mark with `LEGACY COMPATIBILITY` comments and removal plans
- **Documentation**: Update CHANGELOG files after testing, not before

### **Architecture Decisions**
- **Channel-Neutral Design**: All channels use same interaction handlers
- **Modular Structure**: Clear separation between UI, bot, and core layers
- **Data Flow**: User data centralized through `core/user_data_handlers.py`
- **Testing Strategy**: Behavior tests preferred over unit tests for real functionality

### **AI Development Patterns**
- **Use existing patterns** from working dialogs and widgets
- **Follow validation patterns** from `core/user_data_validation.py`
- **Test data persistence** when modifying dialogs
- **Check widget integration** when adding new features

### **AI Development Commands**
- `python ui/ui_app_qt.py` - Launch main admin interface
- `python run_mhm.py` - Launch admin UI (background service started separately)
- `python run_tests.py` - Run tests including UI tests

### **Key UI Files**
- `ui/ui_app_qt.py` - Main PySide6 application
- `ui/dialogs/` - Dialog implementations
- `ui/widgets/` - Reusable widget components
- `core/user_data_validation.py` - Centralized validation logic

### **UI Design Patterns**
- **Dialog Pattern**: Inherit from QDialog, use widgets for data entry
- **Widget Pattern**: Inherit from QWidget, implement get/set methods
- **Validation Pattern**: Use `validate_schedule_periods` for time periods
- **Error Pattern**: Use `@handle_errors` decorator with QMessageBox

### **Testing Framework Standards**
- **Real Behavior Testing**: Focus on actual side effects and system changes
- **Test Isolation**: Proper temporary directories and cleanup procedures
- **Side Effect Verification**: Tests verify actual file operations and state changes
- **Comprehensive Mocking**: Mock file operations, external APIs, and system resources
- **Error Handling**: Test system stability under various error conditions
- **Performance Testing**: Test system behavior under load and concurrent access

### **Test Quality Metrics**
- **Success Rate**: 99.7% for covered modules (384 tests passing, 1 skipped, 34 warnings)
- **Coverage**: 48% of codebase tested (17/31+ modules)
- **Test Types**: Unit, integration, behavior, and UI tests properly organized
- **Patterns**: Established comprehensive real behavior testing approach
