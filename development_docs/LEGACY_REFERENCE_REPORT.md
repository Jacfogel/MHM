## Summary
## Recommended Follow-Up
- Additional guidance: [AI_LEGACY_COMPATIBILITY_GUIDE.md](ai_development_docs/AI_LEGACY_COMPATIBILITY_GUIDE.md)
1. Identify active legacy compatibility behavior and migrate all callers/dependencies to current implementations before deleting markers.
2. Add or update regression tests that prove migrated flows work without legacy compatibility code paths. See [AI_TESTING_GUIDE.md](ai_development_docs/AI_TESTING_GUIDE.md) for additional guidance.
3. Only after migration is verified, remove legacy markers/comments/docs evidence and rerun `python development_tools/run_development_tools.py legacy --clean --dry-run` until this report returns zero issues.
