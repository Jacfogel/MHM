# Legacy Reference Cleanup Report

**Generated**: 2025-10-21 03:58:53
**Total Files with Issues**: 4
**Legacy Compatibility Markers Detected**: 4

## Summary
- Scan mode only: no automated fixes were applied.
- Legacy compatibility markers remain in 4 file(s) (4 total markers).
- 3 file(s) still reference `enabled_fields`; confirm any clients still produce that payload.
- 1 file(s) rely on legacy preference delegation paths; decide whether to modernise or retire them.

## Recommended Follow-Up
1. Confirm whether legacy `enabled_fields` payloads are still produced; if not, plan removal and data migration.
2. Add regression tests covering analytics handler flows and user data migrations before deleting markers.
3. Track the cleanup effort and rerun `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py legacy --clean --dry-run` until this report returns zero issues.
