# AI Testing Status & Patterns

> **Audience**: AI Collaborators  
> **Purpose**: Current testing status and key patterns for AI context  
> **Style**: Concise, pattern-focused, actionable

## üìù How to Update This Plan

When updating this AI-focused testing plan, follow this format:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD - Testing Status Update
- Key testing improvement or status change in one sentence
- Updated test counts and success rates
- New testing patterns or approaches added
```

**Guidelines:**
- Keep entries **concise** and **pattern-focused**
- Focus on **current status** and **actionable information**
- Update **test coverage percentages** and **success rates**
- Document **new testing patterns** for AI reference
- Maintain **chronological order** (most recent first)
- **REMOVE OLDER ENTRIES** when adding new ones to keep context short and highly relevant
- **Target 5-10 recent entries maximum** for optimal AI context window usage

- **Current test results**: 276 tests passing, 1 skipped, 30 warnings - 99.6% success rate
- **Improved test code quality** by following pytest best practices for test function signatures

### **2025-07-28 - Log Rotation System Testing & System Stability**

- **384 tests passing, 1 skipped, 34 warnings** - 99.7% success rate
- **Modules WITH Tests**: 12 (error_handling, file_operations, user_management, scheduler, configuration, message_management, communication_manager, task_management, service_management, validation, ai_chatbot, discord_bot)
- **Modules WITHOUT Tests**: 19+ (core modules, UI modules, remaining bot modules)

### **Testing Patterns**
- **Real Behavior Testing**: Majority use actual file operations and side effects
- **Test Organization**: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/behavior/`, `tests/ui/`
- **Manual Testing Framework**: Comprehensive dialog testing checklist established
- **Validation System**: Enhanced across all dialogs with clear error messages

## üîß **Key Testing Architecture**

### **Test Categories**
1. **Unit Tests** - Individual function testing
2. **Integration Tests** - Module interaction testing  
3. **Behavior Tests** - Real system behavior verification
4. **UI Tests** - Dialog and widget testing

### **Critical Testing Gaps**
- **Core Modules**: `message_management.py`, `schedule_management.py`, `response_tracking.py`
- **UI Modules**: `ui_app_qt.py`, dialog implementations
- **Bot Modules**: Communication channel implementations (Discord connectivity enhanced, testing needed)
- **Account Creation Validation**: Task management validation bug causing test failure

## üìã **Testing Priorities**

### **High Priority**
- **Dialog Testing**: Test remaining dialogs for functionality and data persistence
- **Widget Testing**: Test all widgets for proper data binding
- **Core Module Testing**: Add tests for untested core modules

### **Medium Priority**
- **Log Rotation Testing**: Test app.log rotation functionality
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor UI responsiveness
- **Error Handling Testing**: Verify error recovery across all modules

## üéØ **For AI Context**

### **When Working on Testing**
- **Check test coverage** before making changes to untested modules
- **Use existing patterns** from working test files
- **Focus on real behavior** over mocking when possible
- **Update manual testing checklist** when adding new UI features

### **Testing Commands**
- `python run_tests.py`
