## üìö Reference Information

### Key UI Patterns
- **Widget ‚Üí Dialog ‚Üí Core**: Data flows from widgets through dialogs to core handlers
- **Validation**: Centralized validation in `core/user_data_validation.py`
- **Error Handling**: `@handle_errors` decorator with user-friendly messages
- **Signal-Based Updates**: UI updates triggered by data changes

### Development Guidelines
- **UI Files**: Create .ui files in `ui/designs/` and generate Python with pyside6-uic
- **Testing**: Use behavior tests that verify side effects and real functionality
- **Legacy Code**: Mark with `LEGACY COMPATIBILITY` comments and removal plans
- **Documentation**: Update CHANGELOG files after testing, not before

### Architecture Decisions
- **Channel-Neutral Design**: All channels use same interaction handlers
- **Modular Structure**: Clear separation between UI, bot, and core layers
- **Data Flow**: User data centralized through `core/user_data_handlers.py`
- **Testing Strategy**: Behavior tests preferred over unit tests for real functionality

### AI Development Patterns
- **Use existing patterns** from working dialogs and widgets
- **Follow validation patterns** from `core/user_data_validation.py`
- **Test data persistence** when modifying dialogs
- **Check widget integration** when adding new features

### AI Development Commands
- `python ui/ui_app_qt.py` - Launch main admin interface
- `python run_mhm.py` - Launch full application
- `python run_tests.py` - Run tests including UI tests

### UI Design Patterns
- **Dialog Pattern**: Inherit from QDialog, use widgets for data entry
- **Widget Pattern**: Inherit from QWidget, implement get/set methods
- **Validation Pattern**: Use `validate_schedule_periods` for time periods
- **Error Pattern**: Use `@handle_errors` decorator with QMessageBox

### Testing Framework Standards
