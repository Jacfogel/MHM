# Organization Guidelines

## Documentation
- Add new information to existing md files when possible
- Only create new md files in subdirectories that don't already have one
- Keep documentation concise and scannable

## Scripts
- Place testing, migration, debug, and utility scripts in `scripts/` directory
- Use descriptive filenames and include comments
- Remove obsolete scripts when no longer needed
- Document significant scripts in `IMPROVEMENTS.md`

**TESTING**: If you can see this rule, please confirm by saying "I can see the organization.mdc rule"
