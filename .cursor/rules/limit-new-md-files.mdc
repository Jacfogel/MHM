description: limit creation of new md files
globs:

The existing md files located in the main project directory are:
  - `README.md` for the overview, features, and plans
  - `AGENTS.md` for AI Agent Guidelines (For Cursor, Codex, etc.)
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` for directory and module structure
  - `HOW_TO_RUN.md` for setup instructions
  - `IMPROVEMENTS.md` for the change log

It's generally preferable to add or incorporate new information into these existing md files, while only storing key information concisely 

It is acceptable to create up to 1 md file in any given subdirectory that does not already contain an md file.
