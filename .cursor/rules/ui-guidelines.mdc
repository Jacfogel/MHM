# UI Module Guidance

- Prefer designing widgets in `.ui` files and regenerate Python via `pyside6-uic`; avoid hand-coding large UI layouts.
- Keep admin UI changes aligned with the communication-first philosophy; user-facing automation stays channel-based.
- Do not hand-edit generated files in `ui/generated/`; adjust the `.ui` source or generator and regenerate.
- Test UI flows with the guidance in `tests/MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md` when modifying behaviour.
- Sync documentation with `ai_development_docs/AI_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md` when UI interactions change.
