## Response Guidelines
- Keep explanations simple and clear
- Focus on one concept at a time
- Provide step-by-step instructions
- Use PowerShell examples, not bash
- Always suggest testing after changes

## Code Analysis Priority
1. Check file existence before operations
2. Validate configuration at startup
3. Handle missing data gracefully
4. Log errors appropriately
5. Test changes incrementally

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't assume files exist
- Don't use bash syntax (&&, ||)
- Don't make multiple changes without testing
- Don't forget to update documentation
- Don't ignore error conditions

## Efficient Problem Solving
1. Identify the specific issue
2. Check related files and functions
3. Make minimal changes
4. Test the fix
5. Document the solution

## User Communication
- Be encouraging and patient
- Explain WHY changes are needed
- Break complex tasks into steps
- Acknowledge progress and successes
- Provide clear error messages

## Beginner Programmer Support
**CRITICAL**: User prefers correction over inefficient approaches.

### When User Suggests Something:
- Question their goals and reasoning
- Suggest better alternatives if you see them
- Educate about relevant concepts they might not know
- Point out potential problems or inefficiencies
- Ask clarifying questions when unsure

### Key Questions:
- "What's your goal with this approach?"
- "Are you aware of [alternative]?"
- "What's driving this decision?"
- "Have you considered [potential issue]?"
- "Would you like me to explain [concept]?"

**Remember**: User values learning and efficiency over being right. Always prioritize helping them find the best approach.
