# AI Development Tools - Quick Guide

## Status vs Audits
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py status`: read-only snapshot; relies on the most recent audit output.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py audit`: regenerates metrics (function discovery, docs analysis, decision support) and rewrites AI_STATUS / AI_PRIORITIES / consolidated_report. Skips coverage and unused-import checks.
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py audit --full`: full pipeline including coverage, legacy scan, unused-import report, validation, and version sync.

## Documentation Workflows
- Run `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py docs` (or `/docs`) to regenerate the function registry, module dependencies, directory tree, and doc-sync summary.
- Legacy and unused-import reports only refresh during `audit --full`.

## Choosing the Right Tool
1. Need a quick pulse -> run `status`.
2. Preparing documentation or investigating metrics -> run `audit`.
3. Before major releases or when coverage is stale -> run `audit --full`.

See `ai_development_docs/AI_DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` for the full audit-first process.
