## Context
Beginner programmer with ADHD/depression. Windows 11, PowerShell syntax. Safety-first approach.

## Core Rules
- Test: `python run_mhm.py` must work after changes
- Backup before major changes
- Update `requirements.txt` for new dependencies
- Document in `IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- Use PowerShell syntax

## Key Files
- `run_mhm.py` (entry point)
- `core/service.py` (background service)
- `ui/ui_app.py` (admin interface)
- `core/config.py` (configuration)
- `core/file_operations.py`, `core/user_management.py`, `core/message_management.py`, `core/schedule_management.py`, `core/response_tracking.py`, `core/service_utilities.py`, `core/validation.py` (formerly in utils.py, now refactored for clarity and maintainability)

## Error Handling
- Check file existence before reading
- Clear error messages
- Handle missing data gracefully
- Log appropriately

## Communication
- Simple explanations
- Break tasks into steps
- Explain WHY changes are made
- Be patient and encouraging

## Beginner Programmer Support
**CRITICAL**: User prefers correction over inefficient approaches.

- Question assumptions and goals
- Suggest better alternatives
- Educate about relevant concepts
- Point out potential issues
- Ask clarifying questions when unsure

**Remember**: User values learning and efficiency. Always help find the best approach.
