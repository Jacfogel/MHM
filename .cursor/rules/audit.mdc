# Audit Rules - Documentation & Analysis

## When Audits Help
- Run python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py audit before regenerating large documentation sets or dashboards.
- Trigger an audit when dependency or coverage data may be stale.
- Use python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py audit --full when you need fresh coverage metrics or pre-release validation.
- Skip the audit if recent results already cover the scope of work; reuse the latest artefacts when possible.

## Command Reference
- python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py audit [--full]
- python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py status
- python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py doc-sync
- python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py legacy

## Suggested Workflow
1. Confirm whether existing audit outputs already answer the current question.
2. Run the audit command that matches the required depth (fast vs --full).
3. Review i_development_tools/consolidated_report.txt, AI_STATUS.md, and AI_PRIORITIES.md for key findings.
4. Highlight any critical issues or follow-up items for the user.
5. Record next actions or questions before moving on.

## Documentation Guidelines
- Update existing markdown files in place; add new files only when no suitable location exists.
- Keep summaries concise and scannable while linking to detailed references.
- Maintain pairing between human-facing docs and AI-facing counterparts.
- All tools use `standard_exclusions.py` for consistent file filtering across production/development contexts.

## Script Organization
- Place testing, migration, debug, and utility scripts in the scripts/ directory.
- Use descriptive filenames and inline comments where necessary.
- Remove obsolete scripts promptly and record significant utilities in the changelog.
