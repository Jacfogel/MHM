# Audit Rules - Documentation & Analysis

## Audit-First Protocol (Critical)
- ALWAYS run `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py audit` before creating documentation or broad analysis.
- Use `--full` when you need fresh coverage and test results.
- Share audit findings with the user and secure approval before continuing.
- Base summaries on real data; do not rely on assumptions or stale context.

## When to Trigger an Audit
- Any request mentioning "complete", "comprehensive", "accuracy", or "systematic".
- Generating or updating documentation, registries, dependency maps, or status dashboards.
- Concerns about trustworthiness, reliability, or missing context.

## Required Tooling
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py audit [--full]`
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py status`
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py doc-sync`
- `python ai_development_tools/ai_tools_runner.py legacy`

## Recommended Workflow
1. Run the audit in fast mode, then re-run with `--full` if the situation demands coverage data.
2. Review `ai_development_tools/consolidated_report.txt` for statistics and issues.
3. Capture highlights from `AI_STATUS.md` and `AI_PRIORITIES.md` before summarising.
4. Confirm next actions with the user and document any open questions.

## Documentation Guidelines
- Prefer updating existing markdown files; only add new files when a location does not already exist.
- Keep summaries concise and scannable; link to detailed references when needed.
- Maintain pairing between human-facing docs and AI-facing counterparts.

## Script Organization
- Place testing, migration, debug, and utility scripts in the `scripts/` directory.
- Use descriptive filenames and inline comments where necessary.
- Remove obsolete scripts promptly and record significant utilities in the changelog.
