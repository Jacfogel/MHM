# Project Context - Read Before Working

## Mission & Architecture
- Goal: communication-first mental health assistant (Discord/email channels) with an AI-led experience; users never need a separate UI.
- Core entry points: `run_headless_service.py`, `run_mhm.py`, `core/service.py`, `core/config.py`.
- For deeper background read `ai_development_docs/AI_SESSION_STARTER.md`, `AI_DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md`, and `AI_REFERENCE.md`.

## Working Style
- Prefer code that reflects actual needs; no speculative "defensive" layers.
- Document meaningful work in both `development_docs/CHANGELOG_DETAIL.md` and `ai_development_docs/AI_CHANGELOG.md`.
- Manage tasks: keep active items only in `TODO.md` (grouped by priority); multi-step plans belong in `development_docs/PLANS.md`.

## Quick Reference
- Status snapshots: `ai_development_tools/AI_STATUS.md`, `ai_development_tools/AI_PRIORITIES.md`, `ai_development_tools/consolidated_report.txt`.
- Testing guidance: `ai_development_docs/AI_TESTING_GUIDE.md`, `tests/TESTING_GUIDE.md`.
- Error handling & logging: `ai_development_docs/AI_ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md`, `AI_LOGGING_GUIDE.md`.
- Scripts live in `scripts/` (testing, migration, utilities); update changelog when adding significant tools.
- Paired docs to keep aligned: Development Workflow, Architecture, Documentation Guide, Logging Guide, Testing Guide, Error Handling Guide (human <-> AI versions).
- When unsure about workflow steps, consult the relevant guide in `ai_development_docs`.
