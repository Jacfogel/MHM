## üìù How to Add Improvements

When adding new improvements, follow this format:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD - Brief Title
- **Feature**: Description of what was added/changed
- **Impact**: What this improves or fixes
- **Usage**: How to use the new feature (if applicable)
```


Keep entries **concise** and **scannable**. Focus on **what changed** and **why it matters**.
