# Communication Module Guidance

- Respect channel contracts in `communication/communication_channels`; review channel docs (for example `communication/communication_channels/discord/DISCORD.md`) before modifying handlers.
- Prefer slash-command workflows over legacy `!` commands; deprecate and instrument legacy paths with warnings when touched.
- Ensure message handling remains idempotent and logged via the channel-specific logger.
- Update schema or payload changes across channel adapters and tests; consult `ai_development_docs/AI_REFERENCE.md` for protocol expectations.
