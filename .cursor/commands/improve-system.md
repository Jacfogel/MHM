# Plan Improvements

## Overview
Develop a quality-focused plan for refactors, coverage improvements, or documentation upgrades.

## Steps
1. Review current priorities in `TODO.md`, `development_docs/PLANS.md`, and recent audit findings.
2. Identify pain points (complexity hotspots, documentation drift, test gaps) using audit data.
3. Propose concrete improvements that eliminate duplication and avoid legacy wrappers.
4. Outline the end-to-end impact: code modules, documentation, tests, deployment steps.
5. Recommend sequencing (what to tackle now vs. later) with explicit success criteria.
