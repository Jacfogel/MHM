# Close Session

## Overview
Use this command to wrap up a session and record follow-up tasks.

## Steps
1. Review and update planning files:
   - **Check `TODO.md`**: Remove any completed items and add any outstanding items from this session
   - **Update `development_docs/PLANS.md`**: Add/update entries for ongoing work
   - **Remember**: `TODO.md` is **ONLY for pending tasks** (completed work goes in CHANGELOG files)
2. If there are related entries from today add to them, otherwise add to a new entry to each of the CHANGELOGs:
   - `ai_development_docs/AI_CHANGELOG.md`
   - `development_docs/CHANGELOG_DETAIL.md`
3. Summarise outstanding To-dos, required follow-up testing, and deployment actions.
4. If all work is complete, request confirmation from user to add/commit/push changes.
