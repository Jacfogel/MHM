These commands provide structured checklists for common collaboration workflows. Type `/` in Cursor chat to access them.

## Context Management
- `start-session` - Prepare a new chat using up-to-date project context.
- `triage-issue` - Investigate failures or unexpected behaviour.
- `improve-system` - Plan quality improvements or refactors.
- `explore-options` - Brainstorm what to work on next when priorities are unclear.
- `close-session` - Wrap up a session, run checks, and document follow-up work.

## Tooling Commands
- `audit` - Run the comprehensive system audit.
- `status` - Retrieve quick project status.
- `docs` - Regenerate documentation artefacts and verify sync.
- `review` - Follow the detailed code review checklist.
- `test` - Execute the test suite and resolve failures.

Each command references the relevant sections of `ai_development_docs` so responses stay aligned with project standards.
