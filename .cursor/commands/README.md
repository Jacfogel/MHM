# MHM Cursor Commands

These commands provide structured checklists for common collaboration workflows. Type `/` in Cursor chat to access them.

## Core Workflow Commands
- `start` - Prepare a new chat using up-to-date project context.
- `audit` - Run fast system audit (skips coverage by default).
- `full-audit` - Run comprehensive system audit with test coverage.
- `test` - Execute the test suite, investigate failures and fix any failing tests.
- `close` - Wrap up a session and record follow-up tasks.
- `git` - Add, commit and push changes to git.

## Additional Commands
- `triage-issue` - Investigate failures or unexpected behaviour.
- `improve-system` - Plan quality improvements or refactors.
- `explore-options` - Brainstorm what to work on next when priorities are unclear.
- `status` - Retrieve quick project status.
- `docs` - Regenerate documentation artefacts and verify sync.
- `review` - Follow the detailed code review checklist.

Each command is independent and can be used alone or combined as needed. All commands reference the relevant sections of `ai_development_docs` so responses stay aligned with project standards.
