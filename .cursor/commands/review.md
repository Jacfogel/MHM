# Code Review Checklist

## Overview
Provide a focused review that surfaces blocking issues first. Use this for PRs, targeted module audits, or process reviews.

## Steps
1. Clarify the review scope (PR diff, module, or process) and desired outcome.
2. Evaluate implementation for correctness, clarity, security, and consistency.
3. Confirm tests/documentation are updated; reference relevant guides and run targeted tests when needed.
4. Highlight blockers vs. non-blockers clearly and point to supporting evidence (files, line numbers, logs).
