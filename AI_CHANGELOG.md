## üóìÔ∏è Recent Changes (Most Recent First)

### 2025-08-13 - Robust Discord Send Retry, Read-Path Normalization, Pydantic Relaxations, and Test Progress Logs
- **Discord send reliability**: Queued failed messages when channel not ready; auto-retry once Discord reconnects; prevents lost messages during disconnects. Check-in start is logged only after successful prompt delivery (no duplicates).
- **Read-path normalization**: Added `normalize_on_read=True` option in `core/user_data_handlers.get_user_data(...)` and enabled at critical call sites (schedules, account/preferences during routing) to ensure in-memory data is normalized without rewriting files.
- **Pydantic schemas**: Relaxed `discord_user_id` and `preferences.channel.contact` validators to accept legacy/test formats (e.g., username#discriminator). Kept email/tz best-effort checks.
- **Logging config**: Removed legacy `LOG_FILE_PATH` warning; now always use `LOGS_DIR/LOG_MAIN_FILE`.
- **Test runner**: Added periodic progress output (every 30s) and optional per-test durations (`--durations-all`).
- **Audit**: Ran full audit (high-complexity ~1468). No failures.
- **Tests**: Full suite re-run with fixes; previously failing behavior/integration tests for Discord user creation and data consistency now pass.

### 2025-08-12 - Pydantic validation, legacy preferences handling, Path migration, and Telegram removal
- **Pydantic models**: Added tolerant schemas for account, preferences, schedules, messages (`core/schemas.py`). Integrated normalization at save time in `core/user_management.py` and `core/user_data_handlers.py`.
- **Legacy compatibility (preferences)**: Added one-time warnings when nested `enabled` flags are present under `preferences.task_settings`/`checkin_settings`. On full preferences updates, if a related feature is disabled in `account.features` and the block is omitted, the block is removed with a LEGACY warning. Partial updates preserve existing blocks. Removal plan documented in code.
- **Path consistency**: Continued migration to `pathlib.Path` in core modules; kept Windows-safe normalization for env-provided paths; improved atomic JSON writes with temp+fsync+replace and a Windows retry.
- **Discord config**: Optional `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID` support; avoids slash-command sync warnings if provided.
- **Telegram**: Fully removed Telegram channel (code paths, UI radio, tests/docs). Legacy validators retained only as stubs with removal plan and warnings.
- **Tests**: Full suite green (637 passed, 2 skipped).
- **Audit**: Docs coverage ~99.4%. High complexity functions reported as 1466. Summary files regenerated.

### 2025-08-11 - Discord Task Edit Flow, Suggestion Relevance, Windows Path Fixes, and File Auditor Move
- **Task edit prompts**: Suppress generic suggestions for targeted update prompts; provide actionable, example-driven prompts
- **Parser**: Accepts "due date ..." and "due ..." for updates
- **Suggestion hygiene**: Limit list-tasks suggestions to relevant contexts
- **Windows paths**: Normalize default messages dir usage and path creation; fix tests for Windows separators
- **Testing**: Full suite green (638 passed, 2 skipped)
- **Diagnostics**: Moved file auditor to `ai_tools/file_auditor.py`; integrated start/stop in service

### 2025-08-10 - Channel-Agnostic Commands, Discord Slash Commands, and Flow Routing
- **Central command list**: Added canonical command definitions with descriptions and flow metadata in `bot/interaction_manager.py`
- **Discord app commands**: Dynamically registers true slash commands from the central list; auto-sync on ready
- **Classic commands**: Dynamically registers `!` commands from the same list (skips `help` to keep Discord's default)
- **Flow routing**: `InteractionManager` delegates flow-marked slash commands (currently `/checkin`) to `ConversationManager`; single-turn commands use handlers
- **Unknown `/`/`!` fallback**: Unrecognized prefixed messages drop the prefix, parse via EnhancedCommandParser, then fallback to contextual chat if needed
- **Scaffolds for future flows**: Added `start_<feature>_flow` placeholders in `ConversationManager`
- **Cleanup**: Removed bespoke `!` handlers in favor of dynamic registration; removed `mhm_help`

### 2025-08-10 - Plans/TODO Consolidation, Backup Retention, and Test Log Hygiene
- **Docs cleanup**: Split independent tasks (TODO.md) vs grouped plans (PLANS.md); removed completed plans from PLANS and pointed to changelogs
- **Plan moves**: Moved UI testing follow-ups, Discord hardening, message data reorg, UserPreferences refactor, and dynamic check-in questions into PLANS.md as formal plans
- **Test hygiene**: Added auto-prune for test artifacts in `tests/conftest.py` (logs older than 14d, backups older than 7d; env-overridable)
- **Backups**: Implemented age-based retention in `core/backup_manager.py` with `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30d) plus count-based retention; added `scripts/utilities/cleanup/cleanup_backups.py`
- **Results**: Full test suite green (595 passed, 1 skipped); audit shows docs coverage ~99%

### 2025-08-09 - Test Data Isolation Hardening & Config Import Safety
- **Test isolation**: Ensured tests never write to real `data/users` by:
  - Moving test BASE_DATA_DIR/USER_INFO_DIR_PATH setup to session fixtures only (no env override of defaults)
  - Updating code to import `core.config` as a module (not from-import constants) where needed
  - Tightened a unit test to assert no leakage to real data dir
- **Modules updated**: `core/backup_manager.py` (config module import), `ui/ui_app_qt.py` (config module import)
- **Tests**: Full suite green (632 passed, 2 skipped)

### 2025-08-09 - Logging Architecture Finalization & Test Isolation
- **Component-first logging**: All bot modules now use component loggers (`communication_manager`, `ai`, `user_activity`) rather than module loggers
- **Test isolation**: In test-verbose mode, component logs (including `errors`) write under `tests/logs/`; real logs not polluted by tests
- **Manual async script**: `scripts/test_discord_connection.py` is skipped by pytest; TODO added to convert to `pytest-asyncio`
- **Docs**: Updated `logs/LOGGING_GUIDE.md` with BaseChannel pattern and test isolation behavior

### 2025-08-07 - Check-in Flow Behavior Improvements & Stability Fixes ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Check-in flow expiry**: Active check-in now expires on the next unrelated outbound message (prevents misinterpreting later user commands)
- **Command & prompt**: Added `/checkin` trigger and improved intro prompt with clear cancel/restart instructions
- **Legacy compatibility**: Added shims for `start_daily_checkin`, `FLOW_DAILY_CHECKIN`, and check-in tracking functions to keep existing tests and modules working (usage logged for removal)
- **Stability**: Fixed restart monitor error by iterating over a copy of channel dict (prevents "dictionary keys changed during iteration")
- **Docs generation**: Refreshed function registry and module dependencies
- **Tests**: Full suite passing (591 passed, 1 skipped)

### 2025-08-07 - Enhanced Logging System with Component Separation ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

### 2025-08-07 - Discord Heartbeat Warning Spam Resolution ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Fixed Discord bot heartbeat warning spam** that was flooding logs (2MB+ log files)
- **Root Cause**: Discord bot event loop was blocking heartbeat mechanism due to improper task management
- **Event Loop Fix**: Restructured Discord bot main loop to properly await bot task and handle command queue concurrently
  - Split `_bot_main_loop` into separate `_process_command_queue` method
  - Used `asyncio.wait()` to handle both bot and command queue tasks properly
  - Ensured Discord bot heartbeat mechanism can run without interference
- **Smart Logging Filter**: Implemented `HeartbeatWarningFilter` to intelligently handle remaining warnings
  - Allows first 3 heartbeat warnings to pass through (for early problem detection)
  - Suppresses subsequent warnings for 10 minutes (prevents spam)
  - Logs summary every hour with total warning count
  - Automatically resets suppression cycle after 10 minutes
