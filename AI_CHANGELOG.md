## üóìÔ∏è Recent Changes (Most Recent First)

### 2025-08-19 - Test Coverage File Organization Fix ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**Problem**: Test coverage files (`.coverage` and `htmlcov/`) were being created in the root directory instead of the `tests/` directory where they belong.
- **Issue**: `.coverage` binary file and `htmlcov/` directory cluttering root directory
- **Impact**: Poor project organization and potential confusion about test artifacts
- **Risk**: Test artifacts could be accidentally committed to version control

**Solution**: 
1. **Moved existing files**: Relocated `.coverage` from root to `tests/.coverage`
2. **Updated test runner**: Added `os.environ['COVERAGE_FILE'] = 'tests/.coverage'` to control location
3. **Updated coverage configuration**: Changed `--cov-report=html` to `--cov-report=html:tests/htmlcov`
4. **Updated .gitignore**: Added `tests/.coverage` to prevent version control commits
5. **Verified fix**: Confirmed files are now created in correct location

**Results**: 
- **Clean root directory**: No more test artifacts in main project directory
- **Organized test files**: All test-related files properly located in `tests/` directory
- **Proper separation**: Test outputs isolated from source code
- **Maintainability**: Better project organization for future development

**Files Modified**:

### 2025-08-15 - Comprehensive Logging System Fixes ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Comprehensive testing**: Verified all recent account creation fixes work correctly
  - **Test results**: All 10 tests passed - account creation system fully functional
  - **Verified fixes**: Default message files, tag management, undo functionality, scheduler integration, path resolution
  - **Impact**: Confirmed stable account creation process ready for production use
- **Comprehensive logging system fixes**: Fixed multiple logging issues across the entire system
  - **Discord health checks**: Fixed Discord health check messages appearing in `app.log` instead of `discord.log`
  - **Component logger migration**: Updated 15+ modules to use proper component loggers instead of `get_logger(__name__)`
  - **Script logger migration**: Completed migration of 21 script/utility files to component loggers for consistency
- **Low activity log investigation**: Confirmed that low activity in `errors.log` (8 days old) and `user_activity.log` (15 hours old) is expected behavior
- **Legacy code removal**: Removed legacy compatibility validation code from `core/user_data_validation.py` and replaced with Pydantic validation
- **Logging separation**: Ensured each component writes to its own dedicated log file
- **Impact**: Proper log separation achieved - each component now logs to its own file
- **Modules updated**: 
  - `core/message_management.py` ‚Üí `message` logger
  - `core/backup_manager.py` ‚Üí `backup` logger
  - `tasks/task_management.py` ‚Üí `tasks` logger
  - `user/user_context.py` ‚Üí `user_activity` logger
  - `core/response_tracking.py` ‚Üí `user_activity` logger
  - `core/ui_management.py` ‚Üí `ui` logger
  - `core/service.py` ‚Üí `main` logger
  - `core/user_data_handlers.py` ‚Üí `main` logger
  - `core/service_utilities.py` ‚Üí `main` logger
  - `core/user_data_validation.py` ‚Üí `main` logger

  - `core/user_management.py` ‚Üí `main` logger
  - `core/checkin_analytics.py` ‚Üí `analytics` logger
  - `user/user_preferences.py` ‚Üí `user_activity` logger
- **Path resolution error**: Fixed critical issue preventing default message files from being found
  - **Problem**: `fun_facts.json` and other default message files were reported as "not found" despite existing
  - **Root Cause**: `.env` file contained incorrect absolute path with malformed directory separator
  - **Solution**: Updated `.env` file to use relative path `resources/default_messages` instead of absolute path
  - **Impact**: Default message files can now be found and loaded correctly during account creation
- **Technical details**:
  - **Path issue**: Absolute path in `.env` was causing `os.path.normpath` to resolve incorrectly
  - **Cross-platform fix**: Using relative paths with forward slashes for better compatibility
  - **Configuration**: Simplified path handling to avoid normalization issues
- **Testing**: Verified that `fun_facts.json` and other default message files are now accessible
- **User experience**: New users will no longer see warnings about missing message files during account creation

### 2025-08-14 - Fixed Account Creation Error and Added Undo Button for Tags ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Account creation error**: Fixed critical error preventing new user creation
  - **Problem**: `'ChannelSelectionWidget' object has no attribute 'get_channel_data'` error during account creation
  - **Root Cause**: Account creation code was calling non-existent `get_channel_data()` method
  - **Solution**: Updated to use correct `get_selected_channel()` method from ChannelSelectionWidget
  - **Impact**: New users can now be created successfully without errors
- **Missing undo button for tags**: Added undo functionality for tag deletion during account creation
  - **Problem**: "Undo Last Delete" button was missing from the Task Tags section in account creation
  - **Solution**: Added undo button to tag widget UI and implemented functionality
  - **UI Changes**: Added "Undo Last Delete" button to tag_widget.ui design
  - **Functionality**: Button is enabled only when there are deleted tags to restore (during account creation)
  - **Integration**: Connected to existing `undo_last_tag_delete()` method in TagWidget
- **Technical improvements**:
  - **UI regeneration**: Regenerated PyQt files after UI changes
  - **Button state management**: Added proper state management for undo button
  - **Error handling**: Improved error handling in account creation process
  - **User experience**: Better feedback and functionality during account creation

### 2025-08-14 - Added Scheduler Integration for New Users ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **New user scheduling**: Added automatic scheduler integration for newly created users
  - **Problem**: New users were not automatically added to the scheduler, requiring manual intervention or system restart
  - **Solution**: Added `schedule_new_user()` method to SchedulerManager to immediately schedule new users
  - **Integration**: Modified account creation process to automatically schedule new users after successful account creation
  - **Features scheduled**: Messages, check-ins, and task reminders are all scheduled based on user's enabled features
  - **Error handling**: Graceful handling if scheduler is not available (logs warning but doesn't prevent account creation)
- **Default messages**: Added comprehensive `fun_facts.json` file with 100+ fun facts for user engagement
  - **Content**: Added 100+ interesting and engaging fun facts covering science, history, animals, space, and more
  - **Format**: Properly structured with message IDs, days, and time periods for scheduling
  - **Categories**: All facts marked for "ALL" days and time periods for maximum engagement
- **Scheduler improvements**:
  - **Immediate scheduling**: New users are scheduled immediately after account creation
  - **Feature-aware**: Only schedules features that are enabled for the user
  - **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed logging of scheduling process for debugging
  - **Error resilience**: Individual scheduling failures don't prevent other features from being scheduled

### 2025-08-14 - Fixed Account Creation Tag Addition and Save Button Issues ‚úÖ **COMPLETED & TESTED**
- **Tag addition during account creation**: Fixed critical issue where adding tags during account creation failed with "User ID and tag are required" error
  - **Root Cause**: TagWidget was trying to save tags to database during account creation when no user_id existed yet
  - **Solution**: Modified TagWidget to handle `user_id=None` case by storing tags locally during account creation, then saving them after user creation
  - **Tag persistence**: Custom tags added during account creation are now properly saved to the user's preferences after account creation
  - **Default tags**: Only sets up default tags if no custom tags were added during account creation
- **Save button not working**: Fixed critical issue where Save button did nothing during account creation
  - **Root Cause**: Missing `lineEdit_phone` attribute in channel selection widget (removed when Telegram support was removed)
  - **Solution**: Added safe attribute access pattern using `getattr()` to handle missing phone field gracefully
  - **Button connection**: Confirmed Save button is properly connected to `validate_and_accept()` method
- **Account creation process**: Complete end-to-end account creation now working successfully
  - **Validation**: All validation steps pass correctly
  - **Data collection**: All widget data is collected properly (categories, channels, task settings, checkin settings)
  - **File creation**: All user files are created successfully (account.json, preferences.json, user_context.json, etc.)
  - **User index**: New users are properly added to the user index
- **Additional improvements**:
  - **Inappropriate warnings**: Fixed delete confirmation dialog to show different messages during account creation vs normal mode
  - **Undo functionality**: Added undo for deleted tags during account creation (stored in `deleted_tags` list)
  - **Debug logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track account creation process
  - **Error handling**: Improved error handling and user feedback during account creation
- **Testing**: ‚úÖ **FULLY TESTED** - Account creation works end-to-end with all features (tags, categories, channels, etc.)

### 2025-08-13 - Robust Discord Send Retry, Read-Path Normalization, Pydantic Relaxations, and Test Progress Logs
- **Discord send reliability**: Queued failed messages when channel not ready; auto-retry once Discord reconnects; prevents lost messages during disconnects. Check-in start is logged only after successful prompt delivery (no duplicates).
- **Read-path normalization**: Added `normalize_on_read=True` option in `core/user_data_handlers.get_user_data(...)` and enabled at critical call sites (schedules, account/preferences during routing) to ensure in-memory data is normalized without rewriting files.
- **Pydantic schemas**: Relaxed `discord_user_id` and `preferences.channel.contact` validators to accept legacy/test formats (e.g., username#discriminator). Kept email/tz best-effort checks.
- **Logging config**: Removed legacy `LOG_FILE_PATH` warning; now always use `LOGS_DIR/LOG_MAIN_FILE`.
- **Test runner**: Added periodic progress output (every 30s) and optional per-test durations (`--durations-all`).
- **Audit**: Ran full audit (high-complexity ~1468). No failures.
- **Tests**: Full suite re-run with fixes; previously failing behavior/integration tests for Discord user creation and data consistency now pass.

### 2025-08-12 - Pydantic validation, legacy preferences handling, Path migration, and Telegram removal
- **Pydantic models**: Added tolerant schemas for account, preferences, schedules, messages (`
