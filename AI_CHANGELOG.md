## How to Add Changes

When adding new changes to this brief changelog, follow this format:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD - Brief Title ✅. **COMPLETED**
- Key accomplishment or fix in one sentence
- Additional important details if needed
- Impact or benefit of the change
```

Guidelines:
- Keep entries concise and action‑oriented
- Focus on what was accomplished and why it matters
- Entries should generally be limited to a maximum of 1 per day, if an entry already exists for the current day you can edit it to include additional updates. Exceptions may be made for multiple unrelated changes
- Maintain chronological order (most recent first)
- REMOVE OLDER ENTRIES when adding new ones to keep context short
- Target 10–15 recent entries maximum for optimal AI context window usage
