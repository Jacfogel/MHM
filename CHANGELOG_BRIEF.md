## üóìÔ∏è Recent Changes (Most Recent First)

### 2025-07-21 - Enhanced Function Registry Generator and Coverage Analysis
- Enhanced `ai_tools/generate_function_registry.py` with automatic template generation for improved documentation coverage

- Resolved section parsing logic that incorrectly handled module headers in `#### `module_name.py`` format
- Fixed dependency comparison logic that was comparing imports vs. reverse dependencies incorrectly
- Enhanced preservation logic to retain any content in manual enhancement sections, not just "Enhanced Purpose" markers
- Script now correctly preserves enhanced content and shows stable results on repeated runs

### 2025-07-20 - Enhanced Automated Analysis for Documentation Tools
