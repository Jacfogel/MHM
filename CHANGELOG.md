## üóìÔ∏è Recent Changes (Most Recent First)

### 2025-07-11 - Sent Messages Directory Cleanup
- **Global Directory References Removed**: Eliminated all references to the obsolete global `data/sent_messages` directory
  - Removed `SENT_MESSAGES_DIR_PATH` from core path validation in `core/config.py`

- **Codebase Consistency**: Keeps codebase clean and consistent with per-user sent message storage architecture
- **Impact**: Removes unnecessary warnings and directory creation, improves startup experience
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Global sent messages directory references removed

### 2025-07-11 - Message File Creation Architecture Improvements
- **Refactored Message File Creation Logic**: Improved efficiency and cleaner architecture for message file creation
  - Removed directory creation from `create_message_file_from_defaults()` (now handled by `create_user_files()` during account creation)
  - Made `ensure_user_message_files()` accept subset of categories for targeted creation (validation checks all, updates check only new categories)
  - Improved separation of concerns: validation checks missing files, worker creates them
- **Eliminated Redundant Operations**: Removed duplicate file existence checks and directory creation calls
- **Better Use Case Support**: Different scenarios now use appropriate functions:
  - Account creation: `create_user_files()` creates directory, calls `create_message_file_from_defaults()` for each category
  - Validation: `ensure_user_message_files()` checks all categories, creates missing files
  - Category updates: `ensure_user_message_files()` checks only new categories, creates missing files
- **Impact**: More efficient file creation, cleaner code architecture, and better separation of responsibilities

### 2025-07-11 - Default Message Library Population Fix
- **Fixed Default Message Population**: Updated create_user_files to properly populate user message files from default_messages with correct format (days, time_periods, message_id fields)
- **Created Migration Script**: Added scripts/fix_user_message_formats.py to migrate existing user message files from old format (list of strings) to new format (list of dictionaries)
- **Created Cleanup Script**: Added scripts/cleanup_user_message_files.py to delete unintentional message files for non-opted-in categories and ensure only enabled categories have message files
- **Best Practice**: Message files are now only created for categories a user is opted into, always using default_messages as the source
- **Added Helper Functions**: Created populate_user_messages_from_defaults() and migrate_user_message_format() functions in core/message_management.py
- **Impact**: New users will get properly formatted message files, existing users can run migration/cleanup scripts to fix their files

### 2025-07-11 - User Index Redesign, Survey Cleanup & Signal-Based Dynamic Updates
- **User Index Redesign**: Completely redesigned user index structure to be more relevant and current
