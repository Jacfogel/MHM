## üóìÔ∏è Recent Changes (Most Recent First)

### 2025-07-01 - Check-in & Schedule Management System Improvements
- **Unified Save Method**: Both check-in settings and category schedules now use `save_user_info_data` consistently
- **Data Preservation**: Fixed edge cases where editing one type of schedule could overwrite the other
- **Category Management Bug Fix**: Fixed incorrect nesting of preferences that could cause data loss
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better handling of missing files, empty data structures, and first-time users
- **Consistent Data Structure**: Ensures proper structure for preferences, schedules, and user data
- **Edge Case Handling**: Properly handles first-time check-in enablement and new category addition
- **Impact**: More reliable schedule management, prevents data loss, and handles all user scenarios correctly

### 2025-07-01 - Debug/IDE Config Cleanup & Service Process Investigation
- **Investigated double service process issue**: Confirmed that VS Code/Cursor debug/play button launches an extra service process due to IDE/debugger quirks, not project code.
- **Temporary debug code removed**: Cleaned up print statements and debug logging from `run_mhm.py` and `core/service.py`.
- **Removed .vscode/launch.json and .vscode/settings.json**: Debug/IDE config files added for troubleshooting were deleted after confirming they did not resolve the issue.
- **Impact**: Project is now clean and back to its original state; running from the terminal with venv activated is the recommended workflow for now.

- **Improved Checkbox Behavior**: Removed disabled state from individual checkboxes when "Select All" is selected
- **Better User Control**: Users can now modify individual selections even when "Select All" is checked
- **Automatic "ALL" Conversion**: Enhanced logic to automatically convert all selected items to "ALL" format when saving
- **Smart "Select All" Detection**: "Select All" checkbox automatically updates based on individual selections
- **Consistent Data Format**: Ensures all messages use simplified "ALL" format when appropriate
- **Impact**: More intuitive and flexible user interface for message creation and editing

### 2025-06-30 - UI & Scheduling Improvements
- **Persistent 'ALL' Time Period**: Ensured 'ALL' period is always present as a fallback in scheduling logic

- **Add/Edit Message Dialog**: Improved UI with bold 'Select All' checkboxes, better prefill logic, and clearer labels
- **Time Period Sorting**: Fixed sorting to use true chronological order (minutes since midnight)
- **Treeview Enhancements**: Added ALL DAYS/TIMES columns, improved checkmark visuals, and restored sorting for all columns
- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed issues with missing user files, error handling, and false positive warnings
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Incremental improvements based on user feedback (font sizes, colors, layout)
- **Documentation**: Updated TODO.md and CHANGELOG.md, removed completed items

### 2025-06-29 - Documentation & Error Handling Milestone
