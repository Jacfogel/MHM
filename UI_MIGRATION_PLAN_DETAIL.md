### What This Means for You
This migration has established a solid foundation with the main admin panel working and core backend functionality solid. All UI files exist and dialogs can be instantiated successfully. The new UI is more responsive and looks better. Most dialogs are functional, but some may need testing to identify specific issues.

## üîß Recent Fixes & Improvements (2025-07-18)

#### ‚úÖ **Centralized User-Data Handler Migration**
- **Backend Refactor**: Implemented `core/user_data_handlers.py` to own `get_user_data` / `save_user_data` logic.
- **UI Impact**: All UI and widget modules now import from the new handler module ‚Äì legacy warnings during runtime have largely disappeared.
- **Tests**: Full suite (244 tests) remains green after the migration, confirming no regressions.
- **Next UI Task**: Watch `app.log` for any remaining `LEGACY ‚Ä¶` warnings triggered by UI components and update those call-sites.

### ‚úÖ **Channel Management Dialog Validation Fix**
- **Problem**: Dialog was silently accepting invalid data without showing validation errors
- **Solution**: Added validation error collection and display before saving
- **Result**: Users now see clear error messages for invalid email/phone formats, dialog prevents saving until errors are fixed
- **Files Updated**: `ui/dialogs/channel_management_dialog.py`

### ‚úÖ **User Profile Settings Date of Birth Fix**
- **Problem**: Date of birth was being loaded but not saved when modified
- **Solution**: Added date of birth saving logic to `get_personalization_data()` method
- **Result**: Date of birth changes are now properly persisted to user_context.json
- **Files Updated**: `ui/widgets/user_profile_settings_widget.py`

### ‚úÖ **Test File Organization**
- **Problem**: Test files were cluttering the project root directory
- **Solution**: Moved test files to appropriate directories by type
- **Result**: Clean project organization with tests properly categorized
- **Files Moved**:
  - `test_account_management_real_behavior.py` ‚Üí `tests/behavior/`
  - `test_account_management.py` ‚Üí `tests/integration/`
  - `test_dialogs.py` ‚Üí `tests/ui/`
  - `fix_test_calls.py` ‚Üí `scripts/`

### ‚úÖ **AI Tools Organization**
- **Problem**: `ai_audit_results.json` was cluttering the project root
- **Solution**: Moved to `ai_tools/` directory and updated configuration
- **Result**: Clean project root and proper organization of AI tool outputs

## üìö Lessons Learned

### UI Migration Best Practices
1. **Generated UI Pattern**: Use `pyside6-uic` to generate UI classes, then subclass for logic
2. **Widget Embedding**: Add widgets to dialogs via code, not QUiLoader at runtime
3. **QSS Scoping**: Never use global QWidget rules that can break indicator rendering
4. **Signal Connections**: Connect signals in subclass, not generated code
5. **Layout Management**: Always ensure every widget in Designer has a layout
6. **Testing**: Run `python run_mhm.py` after every change
7. **Documentation**: Update CHANGELOG.md and TODO.md after significant changes

### File Organization Best Practices
1. **Modular Design**: Split large files into focused modules
2. **Clear Separation**: Separate design (.ui), generated code (_pyqt.py), and implementation (_dialog.py)
3. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions throughout
4. **Logical Grouping**: Group related files in appropriate directories
5. **Documentation**: Document all changes and decisions

### Error Handling Best Practices
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Use `@handle_errors` decorators consistently

## üìù Notes

### Important Considerations
- All changes preserve existing functionality
- Data integrity is maintained throughout migration
- Error handling is comprehensive and robust
- Documentation is updated regularly
- Testing is performed incrementally

### Risk Mitigation
- Backup before major changes
- Test incrementally
- Document all changes

- UI is responsive and user-friendly
- Code is maintainable and extensible
- Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date
- Error handling is robust and user-friendly
- Data integrity is maintained throughout migration and restoration

### Migration & Backup Best Practices (NEW)
- Always create a full backup before running any migration scripts or making major data changes.
- Test the migration on a copy of the data first, if possible.
- After migration, verify that all custom user data (such as custom schedule periods) is preserved.
- If any data is lost, use the backup to restore custom content before proceeding.
- Document all migration steps and verification procedures in the changelog and TODO.

### Signal-Based Architecture Benefits (NEW)
- **Real-time Updates**: UI automatically refreshes when user data changes
- **Decoupled Components**: Dialogs don't need to know about main window internals
- **Scalable Design**: Easy to add new dialogs that trigger updates
- **Consistent Behavior**: All user-editing dialogs follow the same update pattern
- **Maintainable Code**: Clear separation of concerns between data changes and UI updates

### Testing Framework Benefits (NEW)
- **Quality Coverage**: 112 tests with 99.1% success rate for covered modules
- **Real Behavior Testing**: Tests verify actual system changes
- **Error Recovery Testing**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery testing
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-module integration verification
- **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing included
- **Confidence**: Make changes confidently knowing tests will catch issues
- **Coverage Gap**: Only 15% of codebase tested - significant expansion needed

## üì® Message File Migration & Cleanup (July 2025)

- **Problem**: During migration, message files were unintentionally created for categories users were not opted into, and some files used the old (string list) format.
- **Solution**: Added scripts to:
  - Delete unintentional/invalid message files for non-opted-in categories
  - Ensure message files for enabled categories are always created from `resources/default_messages/` with the correct dictionary format
  - Preserve any existing message files that are already in the correct format
- **Best Practice**: Message files are now only created for categories a user is opted into, and always use the default message library as the source (never create string-list files).
- **Scripts**: See `scripts/fix_user_message_formats.py` (migration) and `scripts/cleanup_user_message_files.py` (cleanup)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - All user message files are now correct and robust against future migrations

## üóÇÔ∏è Sent Messages Directory Cleanup (July 2025)

- **Problem**: The global `data/sent_messages` directory was obsolete after migrating to per-user sent message storage, but the app was still checking for and creating it at startup.
- **Solution**: Removed all references to the obsolete global sent messages directory:
  - Removed `SENT_MESSAGES_DIR_PATH` from core path validation in `core/config.py`
  - Removed `SENT_MESSAGES_DIR_PATH` definition from `core/config.py`
  - Removed import references from `core/file_operations.py`
  - Added cleanup tasks to TODO.md for future per-user sent message file migration
- **Impact**: Eliminates unnecessary warnings and directory creation, keeps codebase clean and consistent
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Global sent messages directory references removed
- **Next Steps**: Per-user sent message file migration (planned for future)
