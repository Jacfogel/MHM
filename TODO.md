# TODO - Development Priorities

> **Audience**: Human Developer (Beginner Programmer)  
> **Purpose**: Current development priorities and planned improvements  
> **Style**: Organized, actionable, beginner-friendly

> **See [README.md](README.md) for complete navigation and project overview**
> **See [DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md](DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md) for safe development practices**
> **See [TESTING_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_DETAIL.md](TESTING_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_DETAIL.md) for testing strategy**

## üìù How to Add New TODOs

When adding new tasks, follow this format:

```markdown
**Task Title** - Brief description
- *What it means*: Simple explanation of the task
- *Why it helps*: Clear benefit or improvement
- *Estimated effort*: Small/Medium/Large
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use **bold** for task titles
- Group tasks by priority (High/Medium/Low sections)
- Use clear, action-oriented titles
- Include estimated effort to help with planning
- Add status indicators (‚ö†Ô∏è **IN PROGRESS**) when relevant
- Don't include priority field since tasks are already grouped by priority
- **TODO.md is for TODOs only** - completed tasks should be documented in CHANGELOG files and removed from TODO.md
