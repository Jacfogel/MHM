## How to Add New TODOs

When adding new tasks, follow this format:

```markdown
**Task Title** - Brief description
- *What it means*: Simple explanation of the task
- *Why it helps*: Clear benefit or improvement
- *Estimated effort*: Small/Medium/Large
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use **bold** for task titles
- Group tasks by priority (High/Medium/Low sections)
- Use clear, action-oriented titles
- Include estimated effort to help with planning
- Add status indicators (**IN PROGRESS**) when relevant
- Don't include priority field since tasks are already grouped by priority
- **TODO.md is for TODOs only** - completed tasks should be documented in CHANGELOG files and removed from TODO.md


**Note**: Phase 1: Enhanced Task & Check-in Systems is tracked in PLANS.md. 
**Note**: Mood-Aware Support Calibration items (Safety Net Response Library, Task Breakdown Prompt Experiments, Context-Aware Reminder Content Mapping, Mood Re-evaluation Cadence Guidelines) are tracked in PLANS.md under "Mood-Aware Support Calibration" plan.

**Nightly No-Shim Validation Runs**
- *What it means*: Run the full suite with `ENABLE_TEST_DATA_SHIM=0` nightly to validate underlying stability.
- *Why it helps*: Ensures we're not masking issues behind the test-only shim and maintains long-term robustness.
- *Estimated effort*: Small

**Channel-Agnostic Command Registry Follow-ups**
- *What it means*: Finalize and monitor the new centralized command system and Discord integrations
- *Why it helps*: Ensures consistent behavior across channels and prevents regressions
- *Estimated effort*: Small/Medium
- *Subtasks*:
  - [ ] Add behavior tests for dynamic Discord app commands (registration, sync, callback wiring)
  - [ ] Add behavior tests for classic dynamic commands (skip `help`, ensure mapping works)
  - [ ] Verify unknown `/` and `!` prefixes fall back to parser and contextual chat
  - [ ] Ensure user-facing help uses in-app "commands"/slash-commands (no dev-doc references)

**Check-in Flow Behavior & Stability**
- *What it means*: Ensure active check-ins expire correctly and legacy shims are not used in live flows
- *Why it helps*: Prevents stale states and confusing interactions during conversations
- *Estimated effort*: Small/Medium
- *Subtasks*:
  - [ ] Monitor logs for legacy compatibility warnings related to check-ins (`start_checkin`, `FLOW_CHECKIN`, `get_recent_checkins`, `store_checkin_response`)
  - [ ] Verify Discord behavior: after a check-in prompt goes out, send a motivational or task reminder and confirm the flow expires
  - [x] Consider inactivity-based expiration (30-60 minutes) in addition to outbound-triggered expiry (optional) - Added auto-expiration of stale check-ins after 45 minutes and prune on startup/new starts
  - [x] Add behavior test for flow expiration after unrelated outbound message
  - [ ] **Test fixes with real Discord check-in flow and verify flow state persistence** - Restart service and test that check-in flows persist through scheduled message checks
  - [ ] **Monitor logs for MESSAGE_SELECTION debug info** - Understand why sometimes no messages match (review matching_periods, current_days, and message filtering)
