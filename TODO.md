## üìù How to Add New TODOs

When adding new tasks, follow this format:

```markdown
**Task Title** - Brief description
- *What it means*: Simple explanation of the task
- *Why it helps*: Clear benefit or improvement
- *Estimated effort*: Small/Medium/Large
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use **bold** for task titles
- Group tasks by priority (High/Medium/Low sections)
- Use clear, action-oriented titles
- Include estimated effort to help with planning
- Add status indicators (‚ö†Ô∏è **IN PROGRESS**) when relevant
- Don't include priority field since tasks are already grouped by priority
- **TODO.md is for TODOs only** - completed tasks should be documented in CHANGELOG files and removed from TODO.md

## High Priority

**App Log Inactivity Investigation** - `logs/app.log` not receiving expected entries
- *What it means*: Diagnose why `app.log` is empty or sparse and restore expected application logging
- *Why it helps*: Ensures central visibility for non-component events and simplifies troubleshooting
- *Estimated effort*: Small
- Subtasks:
  - [ ] Verify logger configuration (paths/handlers) in `core/logger.py` and `core/config.py` points to `logs/app.log`
  - [ ] Check handler attachment/propagation for root and component loggers; confirm `app` logger exists
  - [ ] Emit a simple startup log from `run_mhm.py`/service to confirm handler wiring
  - [ ] Ensure component logs still write to their own files while general app events go to `app.log`
  - [ ] Add a behavior test asserting a known startup line appears in `logs/app.log` under test mode

**Channel-Agnostic Command Registry Follow-ups**
- *What it means*: Finalize and monitor the new centralized command system and Discord integrations
- *Why it helps*: Ensures consistent behavior across channels and prevents regressions
- *Estimated effort*: Small/Medium
- Subtasks:
  - [ ] Add behavior tests for dynamic Discord app commands (registration, sync, callback wiring)
  - [ ] Add behavior tests for classic dynamic commands (skip `help`, ensure mapping works)
  - [ ] Verify unknown `/` and `!` prefixes fall back to parser and contextual chat
  - [ ] Document command list in QUICK_REFERENCE.md

**Legacy Code Removal** - Remove all marked legacy/compatibility code with clear marking and plans

- *Estimated effort*: Medium
- *High-priority removals*:
  - Account Creator Dialog compatibility methods (by 2025-08-15)
  - User Profile Settings Widget legacy fallbacks (by 2025-08-15)
  - Discord Bot legacy methods (by 2025-08-15)

**Throttler Bug Fix** - Fix Service Utilities Throttler first-call behavior

- *Why it helps*: Prevents over-frequency operations on first execution
- *Estimated effort*: Small

**Schedule Editor Validation ‚Äì Prevent Dialog Closure**
- *What it means*: Validation error popups must not close the edit schedule dialog; allow user to fix and retry
- *Why it helps*: Prevents data loss and improves UX
- *Estimated effort*: Small
- *Status*: ‚ö†Ô∏è **OUTSTANDING** - Previous fix attempt may not have fully resolved the issue

**Check-in Flow Behavior & Stability**
- *What it means*: Ensure active check-ins expire correctly and legacy shims are not used in live flows
- *Why it helps*: Prevents stale states and confusing interactions during conversations
- *Estimated effort*: Small/Medium
- Subtasks:
  - [ ] Monitor logs for legacy compatibility warnings related to check-ins (`start_checkin`, `FLOW_CHECKIN`, `get_recent_checkins`, `store_checkin_response`)
  - [ ] Verify Discord behavior: after a check-in prompt goes out, send a motivational or task reminder and confirm the flow expires
  - [ ] Consider inactivity-based expiration (30‚Äì60 minutes) in addition to outbound-triggered expiry (optional)
