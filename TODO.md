## üìù How to Add New TODOs

When adding new tasks, follow this format:

```markdown
### Task Title
- *What it means*: Simple explanation of the task
- *Why it helps*: Clear benefit or improvement
- *Priority*: High/Medium/Low
- *Estimated effort*: Small/Medium/Large
```

Keep entries **concise** and **actionable**. Focus on **what needs to be done** and **why it matters**.

## üéØ Success Tips

1. **Start with high priority items** - tackle the most impactful improvements first
2. **Break large tasks into smaller steps** - make progress manageable
3. **Test after each change** - ensure nothing breaks
4. **Update this file** - mark completed items and add new priorities
5. **Ask for help** - don't get stuck on any single task

Remember: This is your personal mental health assistant. Every improvement makes it better for you!

- Note: The double service process issue when using the play/debug button in VS Code/Cursor is due to IDE/debugger quirks, not project code. Running from the terminal with venv activated is recommended.

## üßπ UI Migration Cleanup & Consolidation

- **Redundant Methods**: Review and consolidate duplicate logic between Tkinter and PySide6 versions
- **Temporary User ID Pattern**: Document the temporary user ID pattern used in personalization dialogs as a best practice
- **Account Creation Feature Enablement**: Update account creation dialog to read/write feature enablement from account.json instead of preferences (task_management and checkins features)

#### File Organization
- **Generated UI Files**: Consider organizing generated `*_pyqt.py` files in a separate subdirectory
- **Widget Reusability**: Extract common widget patterns into reusable base classes
- **Documentation**: Create UI development guidelines documenting the established patterns

#### Testing & Validation

### Sent Messages Migration & Cleanup ‚úÖ **PARTIALLY COMPLETE**
- ‚úÖ **Global Directory Cleanup**: Removed all references to obsolete global `data/sent_messages` directory
  - Removed `SENT_MESSAGES_DIR_PATH` from core path validation and configuration
  - Eliminated unnecessary startup warnings and directory creation
- **Remaining Tasks** (Planned for future):
  - Move users' `sent_messages.json`s into their messages folder
  - Update the code and current data files to match
  - Update or remove any code that references the global sent_messages directory, ensuring all sent message operations use per-user directories/files
  - Correct the default message library population for users (new and existing)
  - Review and update user file validation

### Legacy Code Cleanup (Planned)
- **Legacy messaging_service field**: Remove fallback references to `preferences['messaging_service']` once all code uses `preferences['channel']['type']`
- **Legacy compatibility code**: Review and remove any remaining legacy compatibility functions and fallbacks
- **Documentation cleanup**: Remove references to obsolete configuration options and file structures

### Legacy messaging_service Field Cleanup (High Priority)
Found in multiple files - these are fallback references that should be cleaned up:
- `ui/ui_app_qt.py` (line 1243)
- `ui/account_manager.py` (lines 1170, 1294)
- `core/response_tracking.py` (line 169)
- `bot/user_context_manager.py` (lines 97, 196)
- `bot/telegram_bot.py` (line 671)
- `bot/communication_manager.py` (lines 530, 814)
