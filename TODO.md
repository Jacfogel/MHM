# TODO.md - MHM Project Tasks

> **Audience**: Human Developer (Beginner Programmer) and AI collaborators
> **Purpose**: Current development priorities and planned improvements  
> **Style**: Organized, actionable, beginner-friendly

> **See [README.md](README.md) for complete navigation and project overview**
> **See [DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md](DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md) for safe development practices**
> **See [TESTING_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_DETAIL.md](TESTING_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_DETAIL.md) for testing strategy**

## üìù How to Add New TODOs

When adding new tasks, follow this format:

```markdown
**Task Title** - Brief description
- *What it means*: Simple explanation of the task
- *Why it helps*: Clear benefit or improvement
- *Estimated effort*: Small/Medium/Large
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use **bold** for task titles
- Group tasks by priority (High/Medium/Low sections)
- Use clear, action-oriented titles
- Include estimated effort to help with planning
- Add status indicators (‚ö†Ô∏è **IN PROGRESS**) when relevant
- Don't include priority field since tasks are already grouped by priority
- **TODO.md is for TODOs only** - completed tasks should be documented in CHANGELOG files and removed from TODO.md

### Test Data Cleanup Standards (Optional but Recommended)
- Pre-run (session start):
  - Remove `tests/data/pytest-of-Julie` if present
  - Clear all children of `tests/data/tmp`
  - Remove stray `tests/data/config` directory
  - Remove root files `tests/data/.env` and `tests/data/requirements.txt`
  - Remove legacy `tests/data/resources` and `tests/data/nested` if present
- Post-run (session end):
  - Clear all children of `tests/data/tmp`
  - Clear all children of `tests/data/flags`
  - Remove `tests/data/config`, `tests/data/.env`, `tests/data/requirements.txt` if present
  - Remove legacy `tests/data/resources` and `tests/data/nested` if present
- Users directory policy:
  - All test users must reside under `tests/data/users/<id>`
  - Fail if any `tests/data/test-user*` appears at the root or under `tests/data/tmp`
  - Post-run: ensure `tests/data/users` has no lingering test users

- *Stabilization steps already taken*:
  - Deterministic loader registration in `core/user_management.py` with idempotent `register_default_loaders()` and guarded import
  - Test-time shim to assemble structured dicts; fallback to read JSONs via `core.config.get_user_data_dir(user_id)`
  - Standardized temp dirs via session fixture; path guardrails to prevent writing outside `tests/data`
  - Normalized env var handling with `monkeypatch.setenv`; snapshot and restore

  - Updated `tests/unit/test_config.py` to use `test_path_factory` and stop creating `tests/data/resources`
- *MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED*: ‚úÖ **GREEN RUN WITH 6-SEED LOOP** - 1144 passed, 1 failed, 1 skipped
- *Parallel Execution Issues Resolved*: Fixed user ID conflicts, file operations, message directory creation, and test isolation

**Create Development Guidelines** - Establish coding standards and best practices
- *What it means*: Write down rules for how code should be written to keep it consistent
- *Why it helps*: Makes the code easier to read and understand, especially when working with AI assistance
- *Estimated effort*: Small

## **Test Isolation Issues Resolution** ‚úÖ **MAJOR PROGRESS**
- *What it means*: Identified and addressed multiple test isolation issues that were causing persistent test failures in the full test suite
- *Why it helps*: Resolves test reliability issues and ensures consistent test results across different execution contexts
- *Estimated effort*: Medium
- *Status*: ‚úÖ **MAJOR PROGRESS** - Identified root causes and implemented key fixes
- *Completed Work*:
  - ‚úÖ **Fixed Multiple conftest.py Files Issue** - Removed duplicate root conftest.py that was causing conflicts
  - ‚úÖ **Enhanced Test Cleanup** - Improved UUID-based user directory cleanup and aggressive directory cleanup
  - ‚úÖ **Fixed Scripts Directory Discovery** - Renamed all test_*.py files in scripts/ to script_test_*.py to prevent pytest discovery
  - ‚úÖ **Improved Test User Management** - Fixed test to use proper user directory structure instead of manual directory creation
  - ‚úÖ **Standardized Test Data Path** - Ensured tests write under `tests/data` instead of system temp directories
  - ‚úÖ **Automatic Cache Clearing** - Added autouse fixture to purge user data caches and prevent cross-test state leakage
  - ‚úÖ **Environment Restoration** - Updated dialog tests to restore `MHM_TESTING` and `CATEGORIES` variables
  - ‚úÖ **Enhanced Diagnostics** - Added targeted logging in `get_user_data` and fixture enforcement to guarantee `mock_config` applies to every test
- *Remaining Issues*:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Full-suite Verification Pending** - Need to confirm no residual isolation failures remain
- *Next Steps*:
  - [ ] Consider making failing tests more robust to handle state pollution
  - [ ] Monitor test stability over time to ensure improvements are maintained

## **Additional Code Quality Improvements** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- *What it means*: Implemented comprehensive code quality improvements including cache key consistency, throttler fixes, dataclass modernization, and dependency cleanup
