## 📋 Executive Summary

### Project Context & Goals
- **Goal**: Modernize the MHM app's user interface and codebase structure for maintainability, extensibility, and better user experience
- **Why**: Legacy Tkinter UI and flat file structure were limiting future development, maintainability, and professional appearance
- **Scope**: Migrate all UI to PySide6/Qt, reorganize files into logical modules, and standardize naming conventions
- **Impact**: Better user experience, easier maintenance, and foundation for future improvements

### Current Status Overview - **PARTIALLY COMPLETE** ⚠️
- **UI Migration Foundation**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Main PySide6/Qt app launches successfully with QSS applied
- **File Reorganization**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Modular structure implemented
- **Naming Conventions**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Consistent naming established
- **Widget Refactoring**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY COMPLETE** - Widgets created but integration issues remain
- **User Index & Data Cleanup**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - User index redesigned and synchronized, survey responses removed
- **Signal-Based Updates**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY COMPLETE** - Implemented but not fully tested
- **Check-in Frequency Logic**: ✅ **REMOVED** - Check-in frequency logic removed; now every applicable time period prompts a check-in
- **Testing & Validation**: ⚠️ **LIMITED** - Only 5 core modules have tests (15% of codebase)
- **User Data Migration**: ✅ **FULLY COMPLETE** - All user data access is now routed through the new `get_user_data()` handler; legacy functions have been removed; robust test coverage confirms correctness and reliability
- **User Profile Dialog**: ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** - All personalization fields now fully functional with proper save/load/prepopulation
- **Admin Panel Startup**: ✅ **IMPROVED** - Now automatically updates user index on startup for always-current user data
- **Feature-Based Account Creation**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Conditional feature enablement with proper validation and tab visibility

### What This Means for You
This migration has established a solid foundation with the main admin panel working and core backend functionality solid. However, many dialogs are broken due to missing UI files and integration issues. The new UI is more responsive and looks better when it works, but significant work remains to make all dialogs functional.

## 📚 Lessons Learned

### UI Migration Best Practices
1. **Generated UI Pattern**: Use `pyside6-uic` to generate UI classes, then subclass for logic
2. **Widget Embedding**: Add widgets to dialogs via code, not QUiLoader at runtime
3. **QSS Scoping**: Never use global QWidget rules that can break indicator rendering
4. **Signal Connections**: Connect signals in subclass, not generated code
5. **Layout Management**: Always ensure every widget in Designer has a layout
6. **Testing**: Run `python run_mhm.py` after every change
7. **Documentation**: Update CHANGELOG.md and TODO.md after significant changes

### File Organization Best Practices
1. **Modular Design**: Split large files into focused modules
2. **Clear Separation**: Separate design (.ui), generated code (_pyqt.py), and implementation (_dialog.py)
3. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions throughout
4. **Logical Grouping**: Group related files in appropriate directories
5. **Documentation**: Document all changes and decisions

### Error Handling Best Practices
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Use `@handle_errors` decorators consistently
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle missing files and data gracefully
3. **Clear Messages**: Provide clear error messages to users
4. **Logging**: Log all errors for debugging
5. **Recovery**: Implement automatic recovery strategies where possible

### Signal-Based Architecture Best Practices
1. **Decoupled Communication**: Use signals to communicate between dialogs and main window
2. **Automatic Updates**: Connect user_changed signals to refresh functions for real-time updates
3. **Consistent Patterns**: Use the same signal pattern across all user-editing dialogs
4. **Error Handling**: Wrap signal connections in try-catch blocks for robustness
5. **Documentation**: Document signal connections and their purposes

### Testing Best Practices
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all critical functionality with real behavior testing
2. **Side Effect Verification**: Verify actual system changes, not just return values
3. **Proper Isolation**: Use temporary directories and cleanup for test isolation
4. **Error Scenarios**: Test boundary conditions and error recovery
5. **Integration Testing**: Test cross-module interactions

## 📝 Notes

### Important Considerations
- All changes preserve existing functionality
- Data integrity is maintained throughout migration
- Error handling is comprehensive and robust
- Documentation is updated regularly
- Testing is performed incrementally

### Risk Mitigation
- Backup before major changes
- Test incrementally
- Document all changes
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Provide clear error messages

### Success Criteria
- All functionality works correctly
- UI is responsive and user-friendly
- Code is maintainable and extensible
- Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date
- Error handling is robust and user-friendly
- Data integrity is maintained throughout migration and restoration

### Migration & Backup Best Practices (NEW)
- Always create a full backup before running any migration scripts or making major data changes.
- Test the migration on a copy of the data first, if possible.
- After migration, verify that all custom user data (such as custom schedule periods) is preserved.
- If any data is lost, use the backup to restore custom content before proceeding.
- Document all migration steps and verification procedures in the changelog and TODO.

### Signal-Based Architecture Benefits (NEW)
- **Real-time Updates**: UI automatically refreshes when user data changes
- **Decoupled Components**: Dialogs don't need to know about main window internals
- **Scalable Design**: Easy to add new dialogs that trigger updates
- **Consistent Behavior**: All user-editing dialogs follow the same update pattern
- **Maintainable Code**: Clear separation of concerns between data changes and UI updates

### Testing Framework Benefits (NEW)
- **Quality Coverage**: 112 tests with 99.1% success rate for covered modules
- **Real Behavior Testing**: Tests verify actual system changes
- **Error Recovery Testing**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery testing
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-module integration verification
- **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing included
- **Confidence**: Make changes confidently knowing tests will catch issues
- **Coverage Gap**: Only 15% of codebase tested - significant expansion needed

## 📨 Message File Migration & Cleanup (July 2025)

- **Problem**: During migration, message files were unintentionally created for categories users were not opted into, and some files used the old (string list) format.
- **Solution**: Added scripts to:
  - Delete unintentional/invalid message files for non-opted-in categories
  - Ensure message files for enabled categories are always created from `default_messages/` with the correct dictionary format
  - Preserve any existing message files that are already in the correct format
- **Best Practice**: Message files are now only created for categories a user is opted into, and always use the default message library as the source (never create string-list files).
- **Scripts**: See `scripts/fix_user_message_formats.py` (migration) and `scripts/cleanup_user_message_files.py` (cleanup)
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - All user message files are now correct and robust against future migrations

## 🗂️ Sent Messages Directory Cleanup (July 2025)

- **Problem**: The global `data/sent_messages` directory was obsolete after migrating to per-user sent message storage, but the app was still checking for and creating it at startup.
- **Solution**: Removed all references to the obsolete global sent messages directory:
  - Removed `SENT_MESSAGES_DIR_PATH` from core path validation in `core/config.py`
  - Removed `SENT_MESSAGES_DIR_PATH` definition from `core/config.py`
  - Removed import references from `core/file_operations.py`
  - Added cleanup tasks to TODO.md for future per-user sent message file migration
- **Impact**: Eliminates unnecessary warnings and directory creation, keeps codebase clean and consistent
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Global sent messages directory references removed
- **Next Steps**: Per-user sent message file migration (planned for future)
