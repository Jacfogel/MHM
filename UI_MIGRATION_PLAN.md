## 📚 Lessons Learned

### UI Migration Best Practices
1. **Generated UI Pattern**: Use `pyside6-uic` to generate UI classes, then subclass for logic
2. **Widget Embedding**: Add widgets to dialogs via code, not QUiLoader at runtime
3. **QSS Scoping**: Never use global QWidget rules that can break indicator rendering
4. **Signal Connections**: Connect signals in subclass, not generated code
5. **Layout Management**: Always ensure every widget in Designer has a layout
6. **Testing**: Run `python run_mhm.py` after every change
7. **Documentation**: Update CHANGELOG.md and TODO.md after significant changes

### File Organization Best Practices
1. **Modular Design**: Split large files into focused modules
2. **Clear Separation**: Separate design (.ui), generated code (_pyqt.py), and implementation (_dialog.py)
3. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions throughout
4. **Logical Grouping**: Group related files in appropriate directories
5. **Documentation**: Document all changes and decisions

### Error Handling Best Practices
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Use `@handle_errors` decorators consistently
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle missing files and data gracefully
3. **Clear Messages**: Provide clear error messages to users
4. **Logging**: Log all errors for debugging
5. **Recovery**: Implement automatic recovery strategies where possible

### Signal-Based Architecture Best Practices
1. **Decoupled Communication**: Use signals to communicate between dialogs and main window
2. **Automatic Updates**: Connect user_changed signals to refresh functions for real-time updates
3. **Consistent Patterns**: Use the same signal pattern across all user-editing dialogs
4. **Error Handling**: Wrap signal connections in try-catch blocks for robustness
5. **Documentation**: Document signal connections and their purposes

## 📝 Notes

### Important Considerations
- All changes preserve existing functionality
- Data integrity is maintained throughout migration
- Error handling is comprehensive and robust
- Documentation is updated regularly
- Testing is performed incrementally

### Risk Mitigation
- Backup before major changes
- Test incrementally
- Document all changes
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Provide clear error messages

### Success Criteria
- All functionality works correctly
- UI is responsive and user-friendly
- Code is maintainable and extensible
- Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date
- Error handling is robust and user-friendly
- Data integrity is maintained throughout migration and restoration

### Migration & Backup Best Practices (NEW)
- Always create a full backup before running any migration scripts or making major data changes.
- Test the migration on a copy of the data first, if possible.
- After migration, verify that all custom user data (such as custom schedule periods) is preserved.
- If any data is lost, use the backup to restore custom content before proceeding.
- Document all migration steps and verification procedures in the changelog and TODO.

### Signal-Based Architecture Benefits (NEW)
- **Real-time Updates**: UI automatically refreshes when user data changes
- **Decoupled Components**: Dialogs don't need to know about main window internals
- **Scalable Design**: Easy to add new dialogs that trigger updates
- **Consistent Behavior**: All user-editing dialogs follow the same update pattern
- **Maintainable Code**: Clear separation of concerns between data changes and UI updates

## 📨 Message File Migration & Cleanup (July 2025)

- **Problem**: During migration, message files were unintentionally created for categories users were not opted into, and some files used the old (string list) format.
- **Solution**: Added scripts to:
  - Delete unintentional/invalid message files for non-opted-in categories
  - Ensure message files for enabled categories are always created from `default_messages/` with the correct dictionary format
  - Preserve any existing message files that are already in the correct format
- **Best Practice**: Message files are now only created for categories a user is opted into, and always use the default message library as the source (never create string-list files).
- **Scripts**: See `scripts/fix_user_message_formats.py` (migration) and `scripts/cleanup_user_message_files.py` (cleanup)
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - All user message files are now correct and robust against future migrations

## 🗂️ Sent Messages Directory Cleanup (July 2025)

- **Problem**: The global `data/sent_messages` directory was obsolete after migrating to per-user sent message storage, but the app was still checking for and creating it at startup.
- **Solution**: Removed all references to the obsolete global sent messages directory:
  - Removed `SENT_MESSAGES_DIR_PATH` from core path validation in `core/config.py`
  - Removed `SENT_MESSAGES_DIR_PATH` definition from `core/config.py`
  - Removed import references from `core/file_operations.py`
  - Added cleanup tasks to TODO.md for future per-user sent message file migration
- **Impact**: Eliminates unnecessary warnings and directory creation, keeps codebase clean and consistent
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Global sent messages directory references removed
- **Next Steps**: Per-user sent message file migration (planned for future)
