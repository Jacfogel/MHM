# ðŸš¨ AI TOOLS TRIGGER

## **BEFORE** creating any documentation, function registry, or comprehensive analysis:

### **MANDATORY STEPS:**
1. **Run `python ai_tools/quick_audit.py`** - Get current state of the codebase
2. **Run `python ai_tools/function_discovery.py`** - Understand what functions exist and their relationships
3. **Run `python ai_tools/validate_ai_work.py`** - Validate your work before presenting to user

### **WHEN TO USE THESE TOOLS:**
- âœ… Creating documentation about functions/modules
- âœ… Making architectural decisions
- âœ… Suggesting refactoring or reorganization
- âœ… Creating function registries or dependency maps
- âœ… Analyzing code structure or patterns
- âœ… Making recommendations about code organization

### **WHY THIS MATTERS:**
- **Prevents incomplete documentation** (like the 15% coverage we found)
- **Ensures accuracy** by using real data, not assumptions
- **Builds trust** with the user by showing actual statistics
- **Improves decision quality** by understanding the full context

### **SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- âœ… Audit results shown before any documentation
- âœ… User approves data before proceeding
- âœ… Documentation based on actual code, not assumptions
- âœ… Completeness statistics provided
- âœ… User trusts the process

**Remember: This prevents the "15% complete documentation" problem!**
