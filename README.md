# Mental Health Management (MHM)

> **Audience**: Human Developer (Beginner Programmer)  
> **Purpose**: Project overview and features  
> **Style**: Comprehensive, beginner-friendly, encouraging

MHM is a simple personal assistant created by and for a single beginner programmer. It sends scheduled motivational messages and basic mood tracking through Discord (email and Telegram are optional). The project also supports optional local AI integration via LM Studio for contextual chat responses.

## Features
- Multi-channel messaging (Discord, Telegram, Email)
- Automated daily reminders and basic mood tracking
- Optional AI-powered replies via LM Studio
- Runs as a background service with an admin panel
- **Comprehensive error handling** with graceful recovery across ALL modules
- **Configuration validation** with automatic setup
- **Modular architecture** for maintainability

### Recently Completed âœ…
- **Comprehensive Error Handling System** - Robust error handling across ALL 22 modules
- **Configuration Validation** - Automatic setup and validation of all settings
- **Core Module Refactoring** - Organized code into focused, maintainable modules

### Partially Implemented
- AI personalization when LM Studio is running

### Planned
- Advanced task management and progress tracking
- Advanced scheduling
- Integration with additional services
- **Testing Framework** - Unit and integration tests

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jacfogel/MHM.git
   cd MHM
   ```
2. Install requirements
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch the app
   ```bash
   python run_mhm.py
   ```
See **HOW_TO_RUN.md** for more details.

### Documentation Categories
- **ðŸ¤– AI-Focused**: `AGENTS.md` and `.cursor/rules/` - For AI assistants
- **ðŸ‘¤ User-Focused**: Development guides and references - For human developers
- **ðŸ”§ Configuration**: `requirements.txt`, `.env` - For both

See **DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md** for detailed organization and maintenance guidelines.

## Architecture
The background service (`core/service.py`) runs independently of the admin UI (`ui/ui_app.py`). `run_mhm.py` starts both together. All data stays on your local machine.

**Recent Improvements**:
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with automatic recovery across ALL modules
- **Configuration**: Self-validating configuration system
- **Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns across modules
- **Enterprise-Grade**: Professional error handling spanning the entire application stack

## AI Integration (Optional)
If LM Studio is installed with a compatible model, MHM can provide local AI chat. The system works without it.

## Important Notes for Beginners

**Safety First**: All these improvements will be implemented carefully, one at a time, with lots of testing to make sure nothing breaks. We'll always have a backup of your working code before making changes.

**Learning Opportunity**: Each improvement will be explained in simple terms, and you'll learn new programming concepts along the way.

**No Rush**: We can take our time with each improvement. It's better to do things slowly and correctly than to rush and break something.

**Your Control**: You can decide which improvements to tackle first, and we can skip any that seem too complex or risky.

**Recent Success**: We've successfully implemented a comprehensive error handling system that makes the application much more reliable and easier to debug. **This now covers ALL 22 modules across the entire application stack!**

For current development priorities and completed improvements, see **IMPROVEMENTS.md**.

## Future Improvements (Legacy)
- Refactor user preference handling through `UserPreferences`
- Expand Discord check-ins with more interactive prompts
- Explore deeper AI integration
- Develop a simple task list with reminders sent via the scheduler, then expand into mood- and context-aware systems
- Add charts showing trends in mood and tasks using Matplotlib or Plotly, later providing detailed wellness analytics
- Use the AI backend to deliver motivational messages or coping strategies
- Break large modules into smaller files
- Introduce consistent snake_case naming
- Centralize configuration in a single module
- Add unit tests for utilities and basic integration tests
- Standardize logging levels and improve dependency error messages
- Build a more interactive Discord bot with quick reactions or forms
