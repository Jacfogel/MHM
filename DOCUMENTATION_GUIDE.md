- **`TODO.md`** - Current development priorities

### üîß Configuration Files
*Used by both AI and human developers*

- **`requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies
- **`.env`** - Environment variables (create if needed)
- **`.gitignore`** - Git ignore patterns
- **`.gitattributes`** - Git file handling

## üìù Documentation Standards

### AI-Focused Documentation Should:
- Be concise and scannable
- Focus on essential rules and context
- Use clear, direct language
- Avoid verbose explanations
- Be organized for quick reference

### User-Focused Documentation Should:
- Be comprehensive and beginner-friendly
- Include detailed explanations
- Provide step-by-step instructions
- Use encouraging, supportive language
- Include examples and troubleshooting

## üîÑ Maintenance Guidelines

### When Updating AI Documentation:
- Keep it concise and focused
- Update both `AGENTS.md` and relevant Cursor rules
- Test that AI assistants can understand the changes
- Remove any redundancy or duplication

### When Updating User Documentation:
- Maintain beginner-friendly language
- Include clear explanations of concepts
- Add examples where helpful
- Keep the encouraging, supportive tone

### When Adding New Documentation:
- Determine the primary audience (AI or User)
- Follow the appropriate style guidelines
- Update this guide to include the new file
- Consider if it could be consolidated with existing docs

## üîç Audit-First Protocol

### What It Is
The Audit-First Protocol is a mandatory system that ensures all documentation and analysis is based on actual data, not assumptions. Before creating any significant documentation, AI assistants must run audit tools to get accurate information.

### How It Works
1. **Run Audit Tools**: Execute `python ai_tools/quick_audit.py` to get comprehensive system data
2. **Show Results**: Display audit statistics and findings to the user
3. **Get Approval**: Ask for user approval before proceeding with documentation
4. **Use Real Data**: Base all documentation on actual audit results, not assumptions

### Available Audit Tools
- **`function_discovery.py`** - Find all functions in the codebase
- **`decision_support.py`** - Analyze code complexity and identify issues
- **`audit_function_registry.py`** - Check function documentation completeness
- **`audit_module_dependencies.py`** - Map module dependencies
- **`analyze_documentation.py`** - Analyze documentation coverage and redundancy

### When to Use
- Before creating any new documentation
- Before updating existing documentation significantly
- When user asks for "complete" or "comprehensive" information
- When accuracy and completeness are critical
- When user expresses concern about trust or reliability

## üéØ Quick Reference

### For AI Assistants:
- Start with `AGENTS.md` for core rules
- Check `.cursor/rules/` for specific guidelines
- Keep responses concise and focused
- **ALWAYS** use Audit-First Protocol for documentation

### For Human Developer:
- Start with `README.md` for overview
- Use `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` for safe practices
- Reference `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for common tasks
- Check `ARCHITECTURE.md` for system understanding

## üìà Future Improvements

### Potential AI Documentation Enhancements:
- Add code examples to rules
- Create troubleshooting guides for common AI issues
- Add performance optimization guidelines
- Include testing strategies for AI-assisted development

### Potential User Documentation Enhancements:
- Add video tutorials
- Create interactive examples
- Include more visual diagrams
- Add community guidelines for contributions

Remember: The goal is to make collaboration between human and AI as efficient and effective as possible!
