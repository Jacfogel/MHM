- Include detailed explanations
- Provide step-by-step instructions
- Use encouraging, supportive language
- Include examples and troubleshooting

## üîÑ Maintenance Guidelines

### When Updating AI Documentation:
- Keep it concise and focused
- Update both `AGENTS.md` and relevant Cursor rules
- Test that AI assistants can understand the changes
- Remove any redundancy or duplication

### When Updating User Documentation:
- Maintain beginner-friendly language
